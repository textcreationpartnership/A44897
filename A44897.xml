            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Most Ingenious and Ingenuous GENTRY, IN THE Kingdome of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> Who seriously mind ETERNITY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Hope the discriminating Character of the <hi>Men</hi> to whom I make this <hi>Address</hi> can justly offend none. I would pray that all the Gentry in this Nation were such and more than such; even <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limely and powerfully Christian, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Holy:</hi> But to entitle all to be so <hi>Noble,</hi> would be accounted a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> by multitudes of them who call themselves Gentlemen. I will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the least asperse them by interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in this Concernment of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. My design only is to engage pregnant wits, and serious spirits in
<pb facs="tcp:48783:4"/> matters of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> to a due consideration of the <hi>Examen</hi> of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course styled <hi>Sure-Footing in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and after all weighed to give their <hi>discretive Judgments</hi> as becomes men loving the <hi>Truth,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reason why I direct this work unto you, is because I do see the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser</hi> boasting, <hi>that it was to his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding satisfaction to understand, that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the most Eminent, solid, and ingenuous wits of our Nation, had been diligent perusers of this Book.</hi> You then are the precious souls, after which he hunts to catch by his <hi>Discourses,</hi> not to save but to destroy you: It will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be no way injurious to you, nor uncivil for a poor <hi>Country-Fellow</hi> to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> you, to look about you; for there are <hi>snares</hi> laid for your souls. I confess <hi>Sure-Footing in Christianity</hi> is such a <hi>lovely Title</hi> to a Book, that it would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure any Serious Christian to hunger after it and peruse it: I could not choose but long to see it when first I heard of it; having a desire to be sure of heaven. But best <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the worst Authors and Books;
<pb facs="tcp:48783:4"/> as this will be found by an intelligent, piercing, Christian Reader. I shall not prejudge, but having perus'd the whole with as much diligence, as I can, I shall offer unto you <hi>the most eminent, Solid, Ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nuous, and Christian wits,</hi> these Animadversions to be weighed thereupon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Title I offer unto your observation, whether any or all his <hi>Discourses</hi> do answer it or make it good, that he hath discovered <hi>A sure-Footing in Christianity;</hi> when the very <hi>Church and Religion</hi> for which he contends, are yet under dispute among many, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Antichristian?</hi> Can he give us <hi>Sure-footing</hi> in disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matters? Again, what greater lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or slipperiness can there be, than in <hi>Common voluntary-talk</hi> from Fathers to Sons, which is his <hi>Oral-tradition</hi> of doctrine? unless there be a <hi>standing-written Record</hi> by which their reports may be tried? Yet herein is the <hi>surest ground</hi> he gives us to stand upon. It is my happiness in some kind that I know not the Man; therefore I can have no personal grudge, nor disrespect unto
<pb facs="tcp:48783:5"/> him nor quarrel with him: but as he is interested in a cause contradictory to the Gospel of Christ, and sure way unto salvation. And herein I profess my self an <hi>Adversary</hi> to his <hi>Sure-footing;</hi> yet so far as to shew him, where he may set his Foot surer for Heaven. For indeed his Title seems to me to be given from the reason of Contraries, as <hi>Mountains</hi> are said <hi>to be from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Montes à movendo, quia mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè movent.</note>
               <hi>because they move not at all;</hi> so may his <hi>Book</hi> be styled; <hi>Sure-footing in Christianity,</hi> because it giveth none at all; but rather sets men on slippery pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whence they easily slide, and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perdition: as is discovered in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of it. As his work is entitled <hi>Sure-footing,</hi> so may he as <hi>Author,</hi> thence bear the Denomination of <hi>Sure-foot,</hi> or <hi>Sure-footer:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:48783:5"/> whom you persecute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I give you here a <hi>finger pointing</hi> to his <hi>Preface, Transition to the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixes, and his Post-script Letter to his Answerer;</hi> where (if words can do it) he sets in the <hi>Front of his Book</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logum Galeatum, <hi>a Preface Helmet-steeled;</hi> not suffering any <hi>weapon-stroak</hi> to pierce into his <hi>Book,</hi> if any will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, when he saith, <hi>It is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Reason strained to its utmost can invent any other Principle</hi> to secure us in Christianity <hi>but his Tradition:</hi> words able to make a man afraid to assault his Discourse, if he were a white-liverd Souldier. And no less hath he guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it in the <hi>Rere,</hi> affixing his <hi>Epilogum Calceatum &amp; clavatum,</hi> that is, shod it with iron, to strike more dangerou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly than an Horse flinging backward; So that his <hi>Body of Discourse</hi> is armed <hi>Cap a Pee,</hi> that he fears no assault, thinking himself <hi>shot-proof.</hi> What else mean his vaunts, and his Laws, which he imposeth on his Answerer? His Postcript of defence being more simple than the rest; For wherein hath he brought controversie from an endless to
<pb facs="tcp:48783:6"/> a Conclusive way? unless it be in this, that all men must yeeld to his Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to <hi>subscribe to Popish-Tradition;</hi> and then we are all friends. I suppose some such easie Protestants he met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to whom he communicated his thoughts, and received approbation from them. His pride in exalting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is displaied enough in <hi>his Transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> As that the Opposers of Dr. <hi>Pierce thought fit to answer his Testimonies;</hi> but <hi>left to him the way of Reason and Principles,</hi> to make his Congress with him. This man then it seems is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Master and Oracle of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son among his Tribe. And again; <hi>It is needless perhaps to the Generality (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever very satisfactory to Examining wits,</hi> such as his own) to confute that in <hi>Common,</hi> which is already confuted by Retail. So then this Gentleman is an <hi>whole-sale Merchant</hi> for <hi>Rome</hi> one of the <hi>better rank,</hi> others <hi>retailers of a meaner trade.</hi> Let him be so, but it had been better spoken by another, than himself. His demands of his Answerer, whereunto he accounts him obliged, are partly Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, which ingenuous men would have
<pb facs="tcp:48783:6"/> observed without his forestalling: but mostly unreasonable and frivolous which to grant, were to yeeld the Cause, and this is begging to the purpose. I have conformed to that which is, <hi>To speak to the main of his Book, and not catch at some odd words;</hi> And therefore have I followed him step by step: though I confess, it liketh me better what I have only seen of an answer made by a <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy person</hi> to this Book,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
               </note> (after I had travell'd thorough it in my way) who hath more concisely and sufficiently me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodized and answered these Discourses; For indeed one sheet of Paper may contain a Reply abundantly satisfactory to the strength of Argument therein. It will be your wisdome then to discern the man and his language.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I propose it to your most serious thoughts and judgments. Doth not <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> bind such a <hi>scientifical</hi> undertaker, (as he professeth himself to be) to give exact explications, and definitions of those terms which must make up his Conclusion? And what loose and <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> descriptions doth he make of <hi>Rule</hi> and Faith singly and joyntly? Can your
<pb facs="tcp:48783:7"/> understandings bear such frivolous and frothy dealings in matters of so high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment as <hi>Salvation?</hi> I think not.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I appeal to you; Is it not most slanderous to say, that the Protestants make <hi>Scriptures-Letter unsenc't</hi> their Rule of Faith? Did ever any of them state it so? Or is it not absurd for him to impose it on them, that by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they must mean the <hi>Letter</hi> only <hi>unsenc't,</hi>

Or, will be deny to God, that which is granted to men, even to sence, and spirit his own word?

<pb facs="tcp:48783:7"/> take a wrong aim, to dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>things delivered,</hi> instead of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it self.</hi> This is his new Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof he boasts, and hopes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to elude his Adversaries, as if they had mistaken in their disputes against Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, to argue against <hi>the matter of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> (as if the Papists held them for faith) <hi>Whereas they mean by Tradition, as the Rule of Faith, only the method of publickly delivering down Tenets,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>Oral-speech</hi> or <hi>words</hi> without sence or matter. It is left to your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to discern, what <hi>a new, nothing,</hi> this <hi>Invention</hi> is; and whether his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had not more wit to maintain <hi>mode and matter of Tradition</hi> to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of their Faith: A fuller reply to this the <hi>Examen</hi> may give.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His reciprocating <hi>Popish-Oral-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> with the <hi>Universal Tradition</hi> of mankin, is to be marked: for so he often styleth it; as if all <hi>mankind</hi> were <hi>Papists;</hi> or his <hi>Oral-delivery</hi> were the speech of them all. Whereas we know there are as many sorts of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Men; and as many sorts of Men as Nations or languages: neither could the
<pb facs="tcp:48783:8"/> spreading Power of the <hi>Roman Beast</hi> over many Nations, make them all of one <hi>Tradition,</hi> as to matters of Religion, though for a time it prevailed much; and that as an Usurper against Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His confounding <hi>Scriptur al Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with <hi>Oral</hi> is to be noted; as usually he doth in citing of the Fathers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he grossely abuseth his unskilful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, perswading that all under the term of <hi>Tradition,</hi> must note his <hi>Oral-Delivery,</hi> when the Author cited mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it of Scripture. How he dodgeth in and out among these <hi>Amphibolies</hi> is worthy of most piercing observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to note out a <hi>Deceiver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. May I in the last place, as to the Man and his work only add this <hi>Item</hi> to you. Let not his <hi>Flatteries</hi> upon one hand, nor his Impudent boldness, presumptuous Confidence, and bitter Invectives against his Adversaries on the other, scare you or byass you: Weigh <hi>Principles and Conclusions</hi> justly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously. He hath hinted that your eyes will be intent upon his <hi>Answerers;</hi> and I dare not suspect your impartial scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of him and his Discourses: Though
<pb facs="tcp:48783:8"/> he account all mad men who oppose him; yet you will finde them in their witts, speaking words of soberness and Truth for Christ.</p>
            <p>Lastly not to extend an <hi>Epistolary Bound</hi> any Further, I shall close up with a Compassionate complaint, and Prayer. Is it not <hi>Pity</hi> that <hi>Royal Heads and hearts</hi> in their respective <hi>Ditions</hi> under Papal power, and noble Spirits in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Stations,</hi> should be enchanted by such seducing Spirits? Lord, reveal thy Son not only unto, but in the hearts of such Princes, Nobles, great, and wise men, who desire to know and love thy Truth; that they may not be given up to beleive lies, but deliver their souls from the snares of those Hunters, and let thy Truth make them free.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>sad</hi> to behold so many great Houses and Families consumed with droppings of sin, smitten with breaches by the Concussions of their Iniquities, and even subverted by Profaneness, Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, and ungodliness, because they will not make <hi>mention of the name of the Lord, nor call upon him?</hi> Lord look from Heaven, and pity these who
<pb facs="tcp:48783:9"/> do not, who cannot pity their own souls, who curse God out of their habitations; and think it their Gentility. Sprinkle them that they may shut their mouths from blaspheming; Let them see what was not told them: and let them consider, what formerly they would not hear, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the secret of thy Salvation. Is it not further to be lamented, to see <hi>nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heads, Pregnants wits, Sagacious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings</hi> to spend their studies upon vain Curiosities; and scarce take up a thought to reach the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the Mysterie of God, of the Father and of Christ? Is it not yet more piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to find such spirits who beleeve the Prophets and Apostles, sit down with <hi>Agrippa</hi> perswaded only to be almost Christians? who content themselves with the letter <hi>and form of Godliness,</hi> and yet never make out to the <hi>power of it;</hi> How sad is this to seem to come so neer to the Kingdom of Heaven, and yet fall short at last. Such slight Christianity makes many halt at this day between <hi>God and Baal:</hi> But they who thoroughly do the will of the Father shall know the Doctrine of

            <p>HE that would walk safely through this <hi>Discoursers Labyrinth of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> needs be wary, lest he stumble at the <hi>Threshold of his Preface;</hi> For it is a kind of a bogling step made up of <hi>even and odd:</hi> Some things are smooth and handsome at which none may fear to trip: but other things are rough and uncouth like an heap of stones, or filth or rubbish lying at the door, over which it were better to leap, than to step upon a loose stone, and indanger a fall.</p>
            <p>That which we look upon as something equal, is a general Rule of Reason, <hi>That there is a necessity of laying down a first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple▪ scientifically to infer any Conclusion:</hi> Here we stand firm.

            <p n="3">3. Another job here is, a <hi>modest</hi> excuse of himself, for his <hi>immodest confidence</hi> in metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing others for scientifical discourses; yet he hopes he doth but second nature in it; and so far it is well, with a jerk to Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> and his <hi>Abettor,</hi> who he saith complains of the same fault in <hi>Papists,</hi> which he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth on <hi>Protestants,</hi> that they put one to answer that which hath been an hundred times said before.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m for laying down a <hi>First Principle.</hi> 2. His <hi>Dilemma,</hi> or catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Argument to <hi>Protestants;</hi> whereby he hopes to hitch them upon the one side, or the other.</p>
            <p>To both these we shall make reply, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have shortly premonish't the <hi>Reader</hi> of this <hi>Discoursers Art</hi> in laying down his <hi>first Principle, and of his groundless Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That no other can be laid to give down the knowledge of Christ and his Doctrine, but his Popish Tradition.</hi> Let these things be noted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his Scientifical method (unto which he most highly pretends) the conclusion
<pb facs="tcp:48783:12"/> which he aimeth to make known through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Discourses seemeth to be this, <hi>That the Traditionary-Faith of the Romish Church, as stated in their Trent-Council, whereof they stand now possessed, is truly the Faith of Christ, which they have uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y received from him unto this day, only by the living voice of his Church which is Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This the Intelligent Reader will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to be the drift of his whole book: <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> then as noting the Romish Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered is the matter, by him to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to infer this, he useth his first <hi>self-evident Principle</hi> as his <hi>Medium,</hi> which is <hi>Oral-Tradition</hi> only, the <hi>living voice</hi> of his Church, and not <hi>Scriptural;</hi> This is <hi>Tradition</hi> (as he styleth it) <hi>sine re Traditâ:</hi> and seemeth hence to reason thus; The Traditionary faith, whereof Romish Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks stand possessed at this day, is truly Christs, descended from him, because it hath been brought unto them by <hi>Oral-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> alone, or living voice, and not by Scripture: Wherein <hi>Tradition</hi> is both <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Conclusion: Traditionary</hi> faith is true, because it is <hi>Traditionary,</hi> or given down by an Oral-living voice. In this <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> is all the strength of this mighty Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser, which he labours to maintain through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:48783:12"/> his Treatise, with all the skill he hath, though all in vain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In his ventilations about this he dodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in and out under the equivocal or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous term of <hi>Tradition:</hi> Sometimes he speaketh of it as <hi>natural and general</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all Mankind, by which things natural of universal and necessary use are given down from man to man: Sometimes he takes it more specially for <hi>Tradition Ecclesiastical</hi> whereby matters of Religion are given down from Father to Son and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s he impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates to his <hi>Romish Church</hi> to have it through Generation and Generation from Christ, which he madly avoucheth to be as exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively and certainly true, as any natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of those things, which are obvious to every eye: As if <hi>voluntary Tradition</hi> were not subject to more mistakes then the known dictates <hi>of nature.</hi> Again, in one place he pretends to speak of <hi>Tradition,</hi> as the mode of del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vering things by living voice without consideration of matters del vered: In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he useth it for the doctrine given out under it. Once more we have him one while speaking of <hi>Tradition-Oral</hi> in his own sence, and another time abusing it in urging the Fathers who frequently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it of Scriptural-<hi>Tradition,</hi> and he still transferrs it to delivery by speech; and no way else. Now he shifting under these am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities deludes unwary souls: But he may

<pb facs="tcp:48783:13"/> will grant; or upon that account are bound to yeeld together with us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great and general Conclusion to be demonstrated in this Science, is,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19. Act. 4.12. Act. 10.43.</note>
               <hi>That God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their sins,</hi> or, <hi>That there is no other name given under heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men whereby we must be saved, but only the name of Jesus Christ crucified, and through faith in his Name.</hi> This is the great Truth concluded in the Gospel, by the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof is eternal life. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Papists also as professed Christians, do or must agree with us in reason.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They will agree (we suppose) in this also, <hi>That the Fathers will revealed by his Son the Eternal word, is the proper, and sole cause</hi> or <hi>Principle making certainly known this way of his Salvation.</hi> He is therefore styled <hi>the word of the Father</hi> discovering him,<note place="margin">Joh. 1, 1.18. 1 Joh. 1.1.</note> and the <hi>word of life</hi> revealing it to the Sons of men.</p>

               <hi>is necessary to make known Gods will revealed as the Rule of their Faith and manners throughout all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:</hi> To this the Trent-Fathers assent, and no less the Discourser here; saving that, They speak of <hi>Tradition</hi> in their own sense, as <hi>Popish;</hi> which we reject as false and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous: And we take <hi>Tradition</hi> genuinly, as that just and honest means by word and writing to give down Gods mind in Christ for salvation from age to age: Wherein it appears, Protestants do not deny but strongly assert that which is <hi>Tradition</hi> indeed of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution.</hi>

Yet we acknowledg there is the <hi>truest and greatest Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> even the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the main Gospel-Conclusion, <hi>That Salvation is by faith alone in Christ Jesus,</hi> whereabout this <hi>Controversie</hi> may be exercised; and so hath been a long time between <hi>Protestants and Papists:</hi> to discover ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>who hold this Faith,</hi> or how they have <hi>had it brought down</hi> unto them, each party claims to have possession of it; and denieth it unto the other. The Protestants prove theirs to be <hi>the true Faith</hi> from the will of God revealed Originally in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and delivered by
<pb facs="tcp:48783:16"/> the Prophets and Apostles and the faithful Witnesses of God, who through all Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions both Pagan and Antichristian have brought down the Discovery of it unto them.

            <p>Now therefore most weakly and absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth this Man make his <hi>Oral-Tradition</hi> to be the first <hi>Principle</hi> to prove his present <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish-Faith</hi> to be true, arguing thus that it must be true; because <hi>Traditionary</hi> by word of mouth, for then every thing so delivered, would be <hi>true,</hi> which is grossly foolish: And as to his pretended <hi>Indefective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of this delivery from Christ it is a <hi>Dream</hi> and will be proved a vanity in the after-Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. And although Protestants urge the <hi>Scripture</hi> their <hi>Principle,</hi> yet is it not for the writings or letters sake, but for the will of God contained in it; For <hi>voices</hi> and <hi>letters</hi> (as such) cannot be <hi>Principles</hi> demonstrating any conclusion of Truth; but only remote means to help men to know such <hi>Principles,</hi> which do infer things issuing from them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively.</p>

               <p n="1">1. He proposeth this as determined by Reason, <hi>That to know the meaning of those words, which express the thing under debate is necessary for satisfaction in that matter.</hi> That Logick assures it to be a ready way to a clear decision of most perplexing difficulties: That the meaning of the word includes in it self the nature of the thing, together with the Considerations and Attributes intrinsecally
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48783:20"/> belonging to that nature; so that we may know what is to be affirmed and denied of that thing: Therefore he applyeth this method unto the present debate about <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> to know the meaning of the words, which may give a clear and brief satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both <hi>what is not that Rule,</hi> and <hi>what is it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this fair and plausible demand, so far as solid Reason doth approve it, we shall grant without dispute. Meanings of words about all Controversies must be understood to bring debates unto a rational period: yet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the reason added, <hi>That words include the nature of things,</hi> &amp;c. Our grant must be with limitation; For notions do not alwayes truly express the nature of things signified by them, but may be dissentaneous or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the same: We therefore thus limit our Grant; That words or names have their force or import from the Authority of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers; If they be by God himself imposed, or by divine Instinct, they doubtless import the nature of the thing, so far as God would signifie it by them: but if words be framed by mens phancies to denote what they would have them, they fall far short of declaring the nature of things, yea and sometimes are opposite thereunto. Notional descriptions of things therefore are oft-times faulty, and help not to knowledge. Let us therefore in our debate consider these words or terms, <hi>Rule, Faith,</hi> and <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> as God speaketh of them in his Word; and we are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48783:20"/> agreed: we shall have there the true meaning of them, and upon good ground may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect clear satisfaction, <hi>What the Rule of Faith is,</hi> and <hi>what not.</hi> No more needs to be said unto this, but to animadvert, That here the Author puts a great stress upon words to open the nature of things; but else-where he sleights words, Grammar, Criticism (in the the best sense) as wordish or airy fansies, when his Adversaries pinch him to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in opening the mind of God thereby in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He begins to tell us what is the meaning of the word <hi>Rule; It signifieth a thing</hi> (saith he) <hi>which is able to regulate or guide him, who useth it:</hi> Hereupon he addeth <hi>that it must have all those qualities, by which it is able to do that, its proper Effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a short account of the meaning of the <hi>Rule</hi> here mentioned; and may serve to describe a Carpenters Rule unto his boy for drawing lines upon Timber to make an Idol:<note place="margin">Isa. 44.13.</note> but we must look for a better discovery of it, as to its nature and use in this place. In general: <hi>Regula est mensura recti &amp; obliqui.</hi>

                  <hi>A Rule is a Measure both of things straight and crooked.</hi> So that the nature of a <hi>Rule</hi> is to be a <hi>Measure</hi> meeting out things measura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and so distinguishing straight from crooked, and right from wrong: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it guides the hand that useth it.</p>
               <p>Yet this general sense is not sufficient in this place; we must therefore descend to specials for the right meaning of the notion.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48783:21"/> This term <hi>Rule</hi> then is diversified in its sense according to the various kinds of things unto which commonly it is applyed: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When applyed to natural things, it hath a meaning natural.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When applyed to things Artificial, and Mechanical it must have a sense sutable, and consistent with those matters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When applyed to Moral concernments, it must have a meaning competent to moral and civil actions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When applyed to divine, and spiritual matters, it must have a sense proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar unto those affairs of Religion, in points of faith and practise. Now to this sense of a Rule (whatever it be found to be) are we bound up in our present debate.</p>
               <p>The use of that word, which is by ours translated <hi>Rule,</hi> we find by the Spirit expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in three Epistles, (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>According to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Rule, which God hath distributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, a measure to reach even unto you:</hi> which Rule was a special revelation of Gods will unto him, that he should abide at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and go through his measure in preaching the Gospel there, because God had much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that place and City.</p>

               <p>Again, we have it in a more large sense, wherein we are now concerned. So we read, when the Apostle had declared that <hi>nothing availed any thing in Christ Jesus,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.15 16.</note>
                  <hi>the Church of Christ, but the New Creature</hi> or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he subjoyneth this incouragement to those, who are conformed thus in Chist, <hi>As,</hi>

                  <hi>many as walk according to this Rule, Peace be on them;</hi> where by <hi>Rule</hi> is meant the Will of God in the New Creation revealed unto them, who share in it, measuring out the line for believing and walking according to his good pleasure, who created them. A like use we find of it by the same Apostle to the <hi>Philippians, Let us walk by the same Rule:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.16. <gap reason="foreign">

So that the sense, meaning or nature of this <hi>Rule</hi> in our debate, (it being divine) is the Will of God revealed, measuring out the lines unto creatures for true believing, and walking safely unto attaining the purchased salvation. Unto this meaning of the <hi>Rule</hi> we shall adhere.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He addeth unto his sence of a <hi>Rule</hi> the proper Qualities of it. as 1. That it must be <hi>evident as to its Existence</hi> unto sense, if it be to guide it; or to the understanding, if it be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48783:22"/> an Intellectual Rule:, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.— 2. That it must be Evident to all those who are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by it, that there is such a thing, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.— 3. That it must be knowable to those who can have doubts in them (that is, in a manner all mankind, even the rudest vulgar) that the Intellectual Rule hath a vertue to guide their understandings right, and so deserveth to be relied on as a Rule. Wherefore it must be, either Evident by its own light, or Evidence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by and to reason, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.—4. That it must <hi>be certain in it self,</hi> or establisht on sure grounds: otherwise it is not possible, that can be in true sense called a <hi>Rule,</hi> which one may follow, and yet go wrong, or be misled, <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>All these properties we freely grant to belong to that which is truly a <hi>Rule;</hi> only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, that there are others also considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be added in their place, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our <hi>Rule</hi> under debate, as any of these.</p>

                  <hi>of God in revealed Truths,</hi> which imports necessarily some <hi>kind of knowledge of supernatural things;</hi> as Heaven its self, and the imcomparably great Good of the next Life: Moreover Love also is annexed by him unto this Knowledge or Faith, (as he parallels

This is all that he giveth in this discourse to make out the sence of Faith.</p>
               <p>With respect to this discovery of Faith, we shall deal openly with the Author, in granting what is true, in desiring what is defective, and in denying what is false in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We grant that <hi>Faith and Believing are synonomous</hi> or of the same signification in the Common sence of <hi>English Mankind;</hi> and that <hi>Divine Faith</hi> is the believing of God in revealed Truths, which imports knowledge of those supernatural good things as Heaven and Eternal Life: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that Faith, which giveth this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of supernatural good things, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love toward them, without which none can come to Heaven; And this Faith is necessary for Salvation unto all sorts of men, learned and unlearned, of higher and of the vulgar sort: In fine we yield
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48783:23"/> this <hi>Faith</hi> to be a special virtue of Christ mainly conducing unto <hi>Bliss</hi> by submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mens understandings unto <hi>Divine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity,</hi> and causing them to adhere to those Truths, which being truly received will raise up souls to Heaven: This is the sum, which we can gather out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words of the Author about, <hi>the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Faith:</hi> and all this we yield free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so far are agreed.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

In all <hi>Religions,</hi> wherein a Godhead is confessed, <hi>true and false, Mahometan,</hi> or other Pagan Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions; as they all pretend <hi>Faith</hi> in their Gods, so none (that we know) arrogate any merit to their Faith, save only Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.

               <p>We shall not weary the Readers with multiplying word for word, but we have those two things to try.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The meaning of those words jointly, <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Properties claimed thereunto in this place.</p>
               <p>To the first, It is but needful to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those words in Syntaxe, as well as in their single posture; and that because the Author changeth often his form of expressing this: Sometimes he stileth it, <hi>the Rule of Faith</hi> as in the <hi>Titles of his Discourse,</hi> and elsewhere: Sometimes he speaketh of it as the <hi>Rule or Means to Faith S.</hi> 9. <hi>S.</hi> 11. <hi>S.</hi> 15. And so several times in his following Treatise: Where also all along he calleth it the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this various Expression in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie we are at a stand, knowing a great difference between <hi>Means</hi> leading to Faith, <hi>and the Rule of Faith it self:</hi> We may grant something to be the means (or as the Author calls it) <hi>a Rule to Faith,</hi> which we shall never yield to be <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> about which Protestants contend with Papists. It was doubtless a good means to bring <hi>Simon Peter</hi> to the Faith,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48783:25"/> when his Brother <hi>Andrew</hi> told him,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.41.45.</note> we have found the <hi>Messias,</hi> So was <hi>Phillips</hi> report to <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> we have found him of whom <hi>Moses</hi> in the Law, and the Prophets did write, Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a good help to lead him to Christ, and to faith in him: no less was the work of <hi>Phillip</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> helping the Greeks to come to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,<note place="margin">Joh. 12▪ 22▪</note> a very ready means to bring them to Faith in him; yet was not this speech of theirs the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> For that was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Will of Christ</hi> himself the Eternal word of the Father, which was revealed to them. We shall yield the same to <hi>speech and writing</hi> of Christ, that they are <hi>means</hi> to Faith, but of themselves no <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the present Controversie therefore we desire to clear the force of this <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (of Faith)</hi> which is not here the <hi>Genitive</hi> of the <hi>End</hi> terminating the <hi>means;</hi> but of the subject regulated or to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ordered by that <hi>Rule</hi> unto which it is subjected; So that the praeexistence of <hi>Faith</hi> in the soul is supposed before the actual regulation of it by the <hi>Rule,</hi> for how can that be ruled which is not? In this sence do the Protestants understand the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> in their Disputes with the Jesuits; wherein these also seem to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, however they shift sometimes in ambiguous expressions: Of this therefore we fore-warn the Author; that we put a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48783:26"/> great difference between <hi>means directing to Faith, and the rule disposing of Faith:</hi> To this we shall keep close in our present work, and make bold to call him back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, where his words vary from it, if he pretend to speak any thing to the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> And this premised, we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider now the properties of this <hi>Rule</hi> as they are proposed by him.</p>
               <p>As to the proper conditions named by the Author, they are not all applicable unto that which is stiled, <hi>a Means or Rule to Faith;</hi> neither as we suppose, so intended by him, but to that which is truly <hi>the Rule of Faith;</hi> which must command, order, and direct Faith to work regularly to its end, which is the salvation of souls: And all these which are orderly forementioned by us as urged by him together with the reasonable grounds of them, we grant, and shall admit them in our further Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination following; but these are not all, to which we are bound up. We desire therefore the addition of others insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that, which truly is <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> which the Discourser must also grant as issuing from the intrinsecal nature and causes of it; and this ground being laid, we shall by them proceed both to the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and Demonstration of the <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> following the Author in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of his Discourses.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48783:26"/>
               <p>All the Properties mentioned by him, are drawn from that habitude or respect, which the <hi>rule</hi> should have unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or subjects to be ruled by it: This in general he makes all mankind, but in special, sorts them into vulgar, rude, or unlearned, and into more intelligent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, or learned men; and into those that are setled in the Faith, and into He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox, Infidels, who are Aliens to it; so again into doubting or Sceptical souls, and such as are obstinate and acute Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries unto the Faith of Christ: with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to these several sorts he frameth the properties of that <hi>Rule,</hi> which he calleth <hi>Means to Faith, and Rule of Faith,</hi> promiscuously and unfitly.</p>
               <p>But those properties, which we desire to add, arise from God the Author and Object of Faith, who alone can give <hi>Rule</hi> to it, and from the nature of faith it self, which is to be ruled by it: as</p>
               <p n="1">1. The true <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> must have <hi>Supream, Soveraign Power, praeceptive</hi> as well as <hi>directive</hi> unto Faith:<note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note> For what is <hi>Faith</hi> in its being, as a special Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, but the creature and workmanship of God? And if so, none can <hi>give Law and Rule to it,</hi> but <hi>its Maker;</hi> and that <hi>Rule</hi> must imply Gods own supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it; no less can order <hi>Faith</hi> than this; The Command of God, and the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Joh. 14.1.</note> therefore must the <hi>Rule</hi> of this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely order it unto God; neither is it to be directed by any other, but what is subordinate to this. He will not have his <hi>Faith</hi> any more than his <hi>Fear</hi> taught by the precepts of men. Supreme then is the <hi>rule of Faith</hi> above all.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32.4.</note>2. <hi>The rule of Faith,</hi> (which is genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and sincere) must <hi>be purely right and strait</hi> not subject to any warping, or yielding unto the crooked dispositions of men. For it is given ftom that God, who is <hi>Rectitude it self;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 19.8.</note> and he hath revealed it to bring souls directly to him-self, that they may not miscarry. Otherwise the Rule of Faith cannot measure true, and false, or right and wrong, which is the most intrinsecal nature of it. <hi>Absolute Rectitude</hi> then is the inseparable <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> is that which giveth a compleat measure, and full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to Faith, for all its Operations toward God: So that <hi>Faith and its Rule</hi> are Commensurate: Likeness of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then, the <hi>Rule</hi> must have to <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>It:</hi> They must meet even, or else Faith will be found faulty and so want its measure: <hi>Proportionating power</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48783:27"/> then is a due property of the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> ordering Faith, its pitch in working, and in its duration.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> consists in <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility.</hi> It is <hi>one, simple, undivided</hi> thing; there is no adding to it, nor taking from it, nor mixing with it: but as <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>simple</hi> Grace singled out to God, so the <hi>Rule</hi> must be as <hi>simple or undivided,</hi> which keepeth <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> and guides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably unto God. <hi>A warping Rule,</hi> will easily make <hi>a warping Faith. Indivisibility</hi> then is a natural <hi>Property of the Rule of Faith.</hi> So much for our Addition; other things might be added, but they will fall either under these, or under the other forenamed by him. And now having gotten this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovery of the <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> we shall go along with the Discourser, and try to what and to whose claim this truly belongeth; as he directeth in his next Discourse.</p>

               <head>THE Second Discourse EXAMINED.</head>
               <p>IN this Discourse to Examine strictly the matters contained in it, we must observe, that after the pretext of the Title; <hi>Shewing the two first Properties of the rule of Faith ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incompetent to Scripture;</hi> there are two general heads offered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Several Presumptions in the 8 former Sections.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Several exceptions pretended to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered from the ninth Section to the end.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Presumptions, we shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in their order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is presumed, that there was a clear Description of the Rule of Faith given in the former Discourse.</p>
               <p>The Author must not be offended if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this, for it is a defective Explication: and let him consider whether the other things sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, do not more discover the nature, and intrinsecal properties of the rule of Faith than his. If he will join issue putting all together we shall consent.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48783:28"/>2. It is presumed, that there are two main Pretenders to the Claim of being the Rule of Faith. viz. <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Scripture:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Private Spirit, Private reason, Testimonies of Fathers &amp;c.</hi> May have a place in the Claim, since they are thought to give unto the respective reliers on them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of <hi>Gods sense</hi> in them. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>We shall accept of this Duel <hi>between</hi> Tradition and Scripture, leaving out all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds or Thirds, to shorten our Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. But by the way, may we suppose that neither of these nakedly taken, can be the rule of Faith, and that not without the Authors concession. For in the close of the first Section, he saith, Gods sence in any of these, that is, points of Faith, is the rule of Faith; and the others obtain that name only, because they are thought to give unto the Reliers on them security of that Gods sence. If the Author will stand to his word here, we are like to put our discourses into a fair way to find out Truth. Gods sence either in Tradition or Scripture is, as we take it, Gods mind or will revealed concerning the way of Salvation, which we assert to be the only rule of Faith: Traditions Oral or Scriptural, are but helps to bring us unto this sence; therefore they can only obtain the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the rule of Faith Metonymically, as due means ordered and annexed to help thereunto. So that the issue is this: Gods sence, mind or will made known in Scripture,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48783:29"/> or Tradition is the rule of Faith only. Our business then is to try, whether his Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>or,</hi> the Scripture of Truth, which we assert, do give to us the sence of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is</hi> presumed with <hi>a Note, that they who say Scripture is their rule of Faith cannot mean by Scripture the sence of it,</hi> that is, the things to be known; for they are the very points of Faith, of which the Rule of Faith is to ascertain us. The rest in this second Section are fruitless amplifications.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reply to this, we deny the Authors presumption as irrational and brutish, How? <hi>Cannot they who say Scripture is their Rule of Faith, mean by scripture the sence of it?</hi> Why so? Is this Impossibility ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Moral,</hi> that they cannot <hi>de jure</hi> or in right reason say so? or, <hi>Is it natural,</hi> that they have no wit, or ability to say so? His Jesuitical Champions against Scripture, have found that they both could and did urge the Scripture senced by God in it self, to the vanquishing of all the proud and blasphemous attempts of those Adversaries against his word. And they had the greatest reason for it and right unto it; for it is brutish to give a sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Rule to men, much more to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers who live by Faith. Unhappy souls must Protestants be, if such an Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were laid upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His reason is as forceless, as his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion wild, yea and crossing to the very
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48783:29"/> words dropt from him in the close of the former Section. There he had said; the Rule of Faith <hi>must give Gods sence, that is, Points of Faith.</hi> Here he saith Scripture as a <hi>rule cannot be meant with the sence of it,</hi> that is, <hi>the things known by it; for those are the very points of faith:</hi> How do these agree? <hi>That which giveth Gods sence, even points of faith is the rule of faith,</hi> and <hi>scripture (which is Gods word) with its sence which are points of faith, cannot be the rule of faith.</hi> His account is, because the rule Faith must ascertain us of the points of faith, therefore it cannot be the same. Had he said, <hi>the means or rule to Faith</hi> do but ascertain us of Gods mind in points of faith, which is its only <hi>rule,</hi> he had made a clear distinction: But the <hi>Rule of faith</hi> is altogether the same with <hi>Gods sence, mind, or will,</hi> in points of Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, which must regulate Faith in all its Actings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a most unjust imposition of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor upon those who <hi>assert Scripture to be the Rule of Faith,</hi> that they cannot mean by the word <hi>Scripture, that book as yet senc't, or interpreted, but as to be senc't;</hi> For in that <hi>writing</hi> there are none but <hi>characters</hi> that may have an <hi>aptness</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Gods mind. Doth the Author think the Protestants in their Assertion, do mean by <hi>Scripture</hi> nothing but the written character or dead letter? sure he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48783:30"/> cannot think so, if he have read their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense for <hi>Scriptures Right</hi> to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of faith upon that account that it doth notifie really and fully the mind of God unto salvation: But if yet he doe think so, and would force them to this, that by the term of <hi>Scripture,</hi> there is nothing litterally carried but <hi>written Charectars:</hi> they are not confined to his thoughts; they know Scripture or the word of God, and the will of God are convertible; and so they assert Scripture to be the Rule of Faith. Will the Discourser suffer it, if we should say, that he cannot mean by <hi>Tradition-oral</hi> which he makes the Rule of his Faith, any word senc't, but to be senc't, which were i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>deed <hi>vox et praeterea nihil,</hi> a meer empty sound? We think not; and yet we shall try him upon that in our progress with him. Let him know in the interim that we both can and will mean <hi>Scripture the Rule</hi> of our Faith, <hi>senc't</hi> by God himself immediately inspiring the penmen of it, when he gave it to them and by them, as well and better, than he can mean his Tradition by word of month senc't, which if it be at all will be found not to be senc't by God, but by the Evil one, Even that Tradition which is <hi>meerly Popish.</hi> We shall leave this his <hi>Quibble</hi> upon the notion of <hi>Scripture;</hi> nothing by the way, that we put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the sence of Scripture,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48783:30"/> which God hath given to it, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation which Man offereth, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he confounds them in this Section. If any thing else be intended in this <hi>Impossibillity</hi> laid on Scripture as a <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith, to be senc't; It must be on this account, that the Rule of Faith is supposed by him not possible to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally senc't; And his discourse then may be summ'd up in such an Argument; <hi>That which is the Rule of Faith cannot be actually senc't,</hi> but <hi>Scripture is asserted to be the Rule of Faith,</hi> therefore <hi>as such it cannot be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally senc't.</hi> The Proposition in this is so fowly false, that a man of Reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend to assert it, and then the whole argument is vain: If none of those be his meaning he must better his <hi>note</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be intelligible; and if in any we have but his meaning, we have also made good that Scripture actually senc't by God, and only so, is the true Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All this presumed by the Author, he proceeds hereupon to apply his two first Properties of the Rule of Faith, <hi>viz. Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its Existence</hi> and <hi>Evidenceableness of its Ruling Power to all;</hi> and to prove that they are wholly incompetent unto Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Ss.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp; 8.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In order to vindicate Scriptures consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency with these properties, we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise these following principles to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48783:31"/> and then infer such Truths as may tend to invalidate the proofs urged by the Discourser, against it.</p>

In the last place, this is the closing Hypothesis. <hi>That the Reason of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for writing his will, which was once only delivered by speech or word of mouth, was to provide against the Evils incident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tradition; and to be as a Touch-stone or Rule to try True and False Tradition by it in all ages.</hi> This is most true, for God himself calleth back straglers by <hi>Tradition,</hi> to <hi>the Law, and to the Testimony to set them right.</hi> But we suppose the Author will boggle at it, and not so easily grant it: Therefore shall we labour to clear it to mens Reasons, and Conscience: by these Considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider we the evils incident to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from <hi>Adam</hi> to Christ: The first Tradition of Gods Covenant for salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given by himself to <hi>Adam,</hi> was by the old serpent corrupted in his Assault;

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 7.1.</note> His wile was to make them forget Gods voice, and so he did: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> delivered the same Law of sacrifice to <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel;</hi> This kept it by Faith unto the death; the other corrupted it, and slew his Brother for keeping it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously: So in <hi>Cain</hi>'s line Tradition of Gods will was falsified, however in the line of <hi>Abel</hi> it was for some time preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in its Truth: So is it evident in the several lines of <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </gap>l-Tradition was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48783:34"/> liable to great corruption; <hi>There</hi> was <hi>Cause</hi> then, why the only wise God should provide against such growing evils in his Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider we the provision made by God against this incroaching corruption, which was two-fold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Extraordinary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.4.6, 12, 17, 26.35. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and that was by his own frequent appearing to the <hi>Fathers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, delivering to them his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and repeating it as necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, by reason of their weakness se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, unto the daies of <hi>Moses;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 19, 20.</note> which also he vouchsafed then to <hi>Israel,</hi> to fix his Law on their hearts; and no less as he thought fit, several waies appeared he to the Prophets to reform the abuses of corrupt Tradition in their respective times which needs no proof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ordinary</hi> Provision also did God make against the falsifying of his <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod, 24.4. Evod. 31.18. Deut. 10.5. Deut. 17.18. Jos. 1.8.</note> which was his command for writing his Covenant, as he began to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of it himself, with his own finger: This copy would he have to be reserved, and laid up, both for Rulers, Priests, and People to order all their thoughts, words, and waies by it; and thereby also to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between Truth and Falshood, good and evil.</p>
               <p>No less upon this account did he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the Prophets in their respective times successively, to write what they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48783:35"/> preached, at least an abridgement of it, and lay it up for a Record to testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst and reform sinners who walked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the vain Traditions of their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.39.</note> Yea further our Lord Jesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self provoked the Pharisees (who by their Tradition made the Law of God of none effect) unto the Scripture, as the great and true Witness of himself. Once more the Apostle by the Spirit of Christ giveth us the sure account of the reason for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gods Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> it was added because of Transgression, that is, to prevent <hi>Israels</hi> warping or turning aside to false waies of worship, by the superstitious and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Traditions of their Fathers. From all which put together it appears that it was Gods mind to have Oral-Tradition tried, rectified, and ruled by his written will, or Scripture; This then must be a better evidence of Truth than the word of mouth by men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As assistent unto the former, we shall adde only this note, Natural Reason, Sense and Experience concurre to make good this Hypothesis: For the strongest and most faithful memory of man may sail sometimes, and therefore their spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches faulter, but if the matters testified be written, and upon faithful Record, this will testifie my mistakes in mens spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as the Authentick Copy by which they must be proved.

                  </gap>l are true. S. 6, —5. It is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but that the Transcribers or Printers have been careless, Knaves, or Hereti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s is hid from the Vulgar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to reply unto these, we shall from the former Truths inferre.</p>
               <p n="1">1, <hi>That the Scripture as to its Existence in the book supposed, is as evident or Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceable to Subjects capable of knowing it: as that there is light, or that there are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorus to such as have the faculty of seeing.</hi> And it is absurd to require that light should be evident into blind men. That
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48783:36"/> there is such a book of Scripture called the <hi>Bible</hi> in the world, All nations Infidel or Christian must confess, as much as they do any known books of men: but to know this to be divinely inspired belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth only to subjects qualified, which some rude and vulgar may be, and some wise and learned of the world may not be, from whom it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s hid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was evident to be Gods word, (as the Author grants) to them in whose daies it was given; So that, what was, may be still.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We assert Faithful Tradition, to have its proper use for making known this book to be the Scripture of God from Generation to Generation: So God orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Fathers to deliver his Law down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to their children,<note place="margin">Psal. 78.5.</note> and these to their succeeding generation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence also it follows, that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> which is the <hi>written will of God</hi> is as self evident to them who can see and read it, as the living voice of any declaring the same to them, who hear it. But to require this to be so manifest unto such vulgar, as are wilfully ignorant, or to such Doubters, who will not be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or to more curious searchers, who make it their work to find out, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil at the seeming contradictions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is most unreasonable; for they are not subjects capable to receive that,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48783:36"/> which the meanest understanding diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercised therein, may and doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We assert, <hi>That it is no less Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or Evidenceable to Subjects capable, even the vulgar, desiring after knowledge, that the number of books, which are the Scripture of God, is determined in the old and new Testament, written by the Prophets and Apostles.</hi> That no more are truly <hi>Scripture,</hi> but such as were written by the Prophets and Apostles, is confessed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other Jesuits: but by the <hi>Trent-Convention</hi> it self unto which the Author subscribeth. It is true that all of them do father <hi>Apocryphal books</hi> upon the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which were none of theirs; but in many particulars appear to be the works of Impudent lyars. And these they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert among the Scriptures of the Prophets which their seduced people do readily swallow down: But never did so much darkness from the bottomless pit so farre prevail as to hide this imposture from the true and seeing witnesses of Jesus, but that they could discover it; and the light shining at this day must needs clear up these mists of delusion, if men were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to see the light. However these proofs we suggest.</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Acts 10.43. 1 Pet. 1.10</note> The Scripture of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which the Author will not deny) beareth witness to all the Prophets, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48783:37"/> they did speak and write of that salvation for sinners purchased by Jesus, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifested in the Gospel. All which writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets are owned,<note place="margin">Rom▪ 3.2.</note> as the Infallible Oracles of God, by the Spirit of Christ. This Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is sure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the new Testament, the known <hi>Titles of the Pen-men, the constant reception of them in the Church, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tradition,</hi> which God hath continued by his witnesses from Age to Age, whose Authority we assert, do give full evidence of its Existence, and ruling Power also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Consciences (It containing with the rest the will of God): So that unless men shut their eies, they may see clearly the <hi>Power of God</hi> in this Scripture inabling it to be the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> Yet we need not any Tradition descending from the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of Iniquity to give Test unto this; but do deny it, as the convoy of all Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood; which the Polemical discourses of the Protestants h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve sufficiently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered against the Jesuits. Let Readers judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We affirm, <hi>That God the Author of the Scriptures gave the first and original Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies in the language known and used in the Church;</hi> viz. <hi>The old Testament in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew mostly, and the new in the Greek tongue.</hi> In these God ordered his Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to preach and write unto his Church
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48783:37"/> in their respective times; And the wisdom of God herein, would not make his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to be Barbarians unto his people to whom they did preach and write. This Truth is made good by Protestant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against that <hi>Trent Constitution,</hi> which maketh their <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> the only <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick</hi> language to correct others by it: We refer for a larger account unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet here we shall suggest some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Objection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We accept from God, and assert, the Testimony of <hi>Faithful Tradition</hi> from the Prophets and Apostles continued by his good Providence thorough all succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages unto this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y. Yet here also we exclude <hi>Popish Tradition</hi> as pernicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly false, corrupting and destroying the Truth of Gods written will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We reject as a most unreasonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that for the just reception of the <hi>Scripture</hi> as the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> the vulgar in every nation must know and understand the Original languages wherein they were given; or be sure of the skill of others in the same. Was it necessary, when the Spirit fell upon the Apostles inabling them to speak the great things of God in the several languages of all the nations, then dwelling in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that they must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Hebrew and Greek, or be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of other mens skils therein, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the words of the Prophets urged, as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48783:38"/> a <hi>Rule of faith?</hi> Was it not enough for them to receive this will of God written by the Prophets, and now revealed unto them in their native tongues, for a Rule unto their Faith? No more necessity is there now, that the vulgar should un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stand the Originals; neither is there just cause for them to mist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ust their Teachers who faithfully open this Scripture to them; seeing they offer their doctrine to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Enemies themselves cannot just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gainsay it; and the very <hi>Truth</hi> revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from Scripture in their <hi>Mother Tongue,</hi> carrieth self Evidence in it to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. This then is too frivolous, any way to impede the Scripture to be the <hi>Rule of faith,</hi> for the want of Evidence or Evidenceableness of its Existent Power. The Author hath more Cause to find fault with his own <hi>Tradition,</hi> which teacheth their vulgar to worship God in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue; which is both abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God and destructive to those poor deluded souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>We</hi> conclude, <hi>that the same God, who gave the Scriptures in the first Copy; as he did inable his servants to speak it in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: so doubtless ordered he them to write those revelations of God to the nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in their own Languages;</hi> which was no more, than the Translations of them; whence others in successive times attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same work for the edifying of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48783:38"/> Church, and informing others. So that it is not impossible but that the <hi>Truth of Scripture</hi> may be self-evident, though translated: it is not word, but matter, which is the <hi>Rule of faith.</hi> Yet more distinctly to return to this</p>
               <p n="1">1. We suppose there may be litteral mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes in Translations, yet are these tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and corrigible by other hands; So there is a remedy: But among all none are more vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ely corrupt, and justly culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the Authors vulgar Latin, which his Tradition upholdeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We acknowledge, that in these, that Scripture which holdeth forth the will of God to salvation, is self-Evident; and to be known.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We embrace <hi>faithful Tradition,</hi> as a good Testimony in this case also; though we refuse <hi>Popish fables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is unequa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to require the vulgar to have skill in all Translations before they can take <hi>Scripture as a Rule of faith;</hi> It is enough that they receive the Truth of God from thence, by those who faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully declare it, and believe it, because it is written. But as to the matter of Translations and their force, it is a work of a larger scope, however the Author do but touch it here to make a stumbling block; we must therefore referre to the greater works of Protestants clearing this: and note by the way that no soul hath

               <p>And lastly to his Censure that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect phrenzy to deny, that to search out the sence of Scripture is not a task for the vulgar, we shall only inquire of him: Did not Christ speak to the vulgar among the rest, when he said, Search the Scriptures, they are they which testifie of me? Did he not therein propose the <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith to them, as a task or work fit for them to undertake? or was Christ phrantick when he layeth such a task upon every one that would be saved, or is capable of it? Of such phrenzy we are not afraid to be by this Discourser charged as guilty.

               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny yet, that <hi>Scriptures Letter without its sence is our Rule of Faith,</hi> though the Discourser would fasten it upon us throughout; <hi>It is a Rudiment</hi> remotely hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to it, as <hi>speech is:</hi> but not the Rule of Faith it self, as we have before sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet we acknowledge; Protestants do deny Gods Assistance to the <hi>Popish Church,</hi> as being <hi>none of his,</hi> but <hi>false</hi> and <hi>Adulterate,</hi> however the <hi>Discourser</hi> means no Church else, thorough his whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: But we espie his drift.</p>
               <p>He asks then, how we are certain in our way of such an Assistance.</p>
               <p>We answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are of the Church, and true Body of Christ while by Faith we are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ed to him as the Head.</p>

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48783:42"/>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16.18. Joh. 16.13.</note>2. We have many very great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises in this Scripture, (which he cannot deny to be the word of God) and these secure us being beleeved by us, both of Gods Assistance, and his Providence preserving his written will unto us.</p>
               <p>He demands again, that we must make our <hi>Rule in Scripture Certain,</hi> before we mention Faith, Church or Gods Assistance. For the Rule of Faith is the means to bring to it, and this must be certain Antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the Notions of <hi>Faith, Faithful</hi> or <hi>Church, Sect.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>We grant his demand, and therefore say.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God himself hath given Testimony to the certainty of Scriptures <hi>Truth,</hi> which makes it the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his will to be written.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The letter of this Scripture is but a means unto, not a <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith; and by hearing and reading the same we come to know the <hi>will of God,</hi> which <hi>is the Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is strange, that here the <hi>Discourser</hi> asserts, that the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> must be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the notion of <hi>Faith,</hi> and that also, to the notion of Faithful or the Church; Else where he saith, upon the Account of his Tradition, that the Church must precede this Tradition, and this <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe</hi> Faith, he rings the changes: but we freely grant, the Rule of Faith from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We conclude, that by Faith in this <hi>Gods-Scripture-Rule,</hi> we are gathered into Fellowship with the Father, Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with the Apostles and Saints of God, and so are of his Church; neither need we the help of the Authors Tradition, <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> to secure us further: We are sure being b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. He pretends, that some do urge, the <hi>Testimonies of Councils,</hi> or <hi>Fathers,</hi> to be <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Interpreters of Scripture,</hi> and so they make up the defects objected by him.</p>
               <p>We shall first return to this passage, and explicate the Protestants allegation of Councils and Fathers in this Case.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They do honour Councils and Fathers which are such indeed; and they are such only who honour God, and subject their determinations unto his written will: And in this point we assert that Article of the Church of <hi>England</hi> concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Scripture makes Councils and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers such as God will own; They make not Scripture either in letter or Sence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They pin not their <hi>Faith</hi> upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these, as if they gave them their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48783:43"/>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> for beleeving, but acknowledge the grace of God given unto them, if they open rightly <hi>Scripture Rule,</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the mind of God therein, and upon that account thank God for them.</p>
               <p>In the next place, from this supposed Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the Discourser draweth some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents, which we shall weigh.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if the Allegation be true, then none can be <hi>capable</hi> of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> nor of Faith it self, but those who are read in Councils and Fathers.</p>
               <p>Unto this shortly we say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let this absurdity-consequent be laid upon them; who so make the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as he represents it, which no sound Protestant will do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny this Consequence from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e explication premised; Christians are true Believers by knowing Scriptures, and not Councils nor Fathers.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.20.</note>
                  <hi>Believe his Prophets and ye shall prosper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He inferreth if the Councils and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers help the Rule of Faith, they must be accounted <hi>Infallible,</hi> which (he saith) none, but Catholicks, that is, <hi>Romish</hi> or <hi>Pseudo-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> will say: or else they must urge some other infallible guide to interpret the Scriptures by.</p>
               <p>Hereunto also we reply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let them who alledge Councils to the purpose pretended, fence off this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, we know none such.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48783:43"/>2. We deny Councils and Fathers to be infallible; no true Catholicks will grant it, though false ones do: That Council of the Apostles only was such, who could truly say, it seemeth good to the Holy Ghost and us: All successive were good, as farre as they walked by the same Rule, but none infallible: neither did any of them ever pretend to be so: Only spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conventions, have dared to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the spirits presence, when the Devil himself acted them in decreeing against Gods written truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We assert God the best interpreter of himself, and so his Scripture of it self; It is a light and a lamp to them that walk thereby in the way unto Salvation: To this infallible guide Gods spirit in his word we adhere.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The last fault he finds about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Allegation, is concerning the notions of <hi>Fathers, Councils, Church and rule of Faith,</hi> and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r order. A <hi>Father,</hi> he saith, is an eminent and known witnesser to Posterity of the sence and Faith of the <hi>Church:</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is a notion presupposed to a <hi>Father:</hi> A Council is a <hi>representative of the Church,</hi> and a <hi>right Council of the true Church,</hi> which he meaneth Romish and Popish only. <hi>Council</hi> therefore and <hi>Father</hi> presuppose <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> presupposeth <hi>Faithful,</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> presupposeth <hi>Faith, and Faith the rule of Faith:</hi> In vain then do they strive
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48783:44"/> to piece out the sufficiency of Scriptures let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be the Rule of Faith by these helps, seeing that <hi>Rule</hi> must give being to all these <hi>S.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Unto this plainly we return.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Notions and order of <hi>rule of Faith, Faith, Faithful, Church, Councils and Fathers</hi> we will not contend with him, if they be understood genuinely, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively to Popish notions of all those things.</p>
               <p n="2">2, We assert also, that our <hi>rule of Faith</hi> which is the will of God revealed in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> must foregoe <hi>Faith,</hi> Faithful, Church and every member or part appertaining thereunto, for it doth give being to all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let them therefore, who strive to piece out the sufficiency of Scriptures let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be the Rule of Faith, by the help of <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> lye under the blame which the Author casts upon them: We are not concerned, nor any of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches in this matter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the close of this we shall animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert; that here he speaketh to his own case, as much as ours, that his <hi>rule of faith</hi> which is <hi>Oral-Tradition foregoeth faith, Faithful, Church, &amp;c.</hi> And yet elsewhere, <hi>Church</hi> must foregoe the <hi>Tradition,</hi> and one mouth must deliver it to another, is not this to run in a ring, and to be a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Discourser? <hi>Viderit ipse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48783:44"/>4. The last Exception against his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he saith is, some reply that <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are clear in Scripture,</hi> which may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to evidence it to be the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This also we affirm in the Apostles words that the houshold of God are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; and all this is revealed in their writings by the Lord. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore clear in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Yet he objects to this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by sufficient Authority a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Catalogue of Fundamentals, was never given or agreed unto: And the discourse grows ticklish when we talk of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and hazardous upon the mistake of one to ruine all.</p>
               <p>Whereunto we shall only say.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Gods Authority is all-sufficient to lay the Fundamentals of salvation, which he hath done in the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apostles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>foundation</hi> or the <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ground</hi> of mans Salvation is but <hi>one,</hi> the Catalogue then is soon made:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note>
                  <hi>other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</hi> Understand we this ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>foundation personal,</hi> which is the person of Christ, upon which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of beleevers are built as living stones to make an house for God; This is but

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.

As to other subordinate <hi>Truths</hi> naturally deduced from this, how few or many soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they be, they may be called seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Fundamentals; neither can it be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous to the end of Faith, that is, mans salvation to treat solidly of them.

               <p n="2">2. He expostulates, Is it in a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that Christ is God? if so, he asks again whether this be clearer in Scripture, than that God hath hands, feet, nostrils, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions like ours?

               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48783:45"/>
               <p>To solve all this difficulty.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That which is the Rule of Faith, must have in it an Aptness to settle and justifie these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned persons who rely undoubtingly upon it,</hi> but, <hi>the Scripture hath not in it such an apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to settle and justifie such persons, unlearned
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48783:46"/> and undoubtingly relying thereon. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is not competent unto it.</hi> The Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the first Section, and the Assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the second.</p>
               <p>Having the argument in this form, we shall try the premisses, and then judge of the conclusion, 1. As to the proposition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Subject herein is the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> the main point in hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Attribute is the <hi>Property</hi> spoken of it, <hi>Aptness to settle and justyfie those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned persons, who rely undoubtedly on it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The connection between these is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; This <hi>Rule must</hi> have this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now before we affirm or deny, it is need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul to distinguish about the <hi>justifying and settling power</hi> of the Rule.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may respect the way of believing (which the Discourser passeth over,) that it must <hi>justifie Faith</hi> to be <hi>the way of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It doth respect persons rulable by it, whom here he only mentions, to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned</hi> persons, <hi>relying undoubtingly</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; who are to be distinguished also.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Unlearned</hi> may be understood, either <hi>absolutely and simply</hi> such, who are meer sots; or <hi>comparatively</hi> such; who though <hi>unlearned</hi> in respect of men more skilful; yet have a reasonable understanding exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised according to their capacity for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the will of God as revealed in the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:48783:47"/>2. <hi>Undoubtedly relying,</hi> may note, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther souls foolishly <hi>presumptuous,</hi> or else through faith <hi>beleevingly confident,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly walking thereby: Hence we thus determine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a necessary property for the Rule of Faith to justifie the way of believing, and those that are not much learned, yet beleevingly confident and undoubtingly relying on it, yea and to settle them while regularly walking by it. The proposition thus stated we grant. <hi>The Rule of Faith</hi> must have such an aptness to justifie and settle these.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this be meant of such unlearned ones, as are grossely ignorant, rude, and sottish pretenders to the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> and yet presumptuously undoubting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; we utterly deny the Proposition, <hi>The Rule</hi> of Faith hath no such property as an aptness to justifie or settle such persons in their grosse ignorance, presumptuous confidence, and irregular walking in their profession of the same. In this sence we put the Author to the proofe of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. <hi>No Rule is bound to justifie irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities in any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Proposition being granted in the former sence, we deny the Assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the <hi>Scripture hath not such an apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to justifie and settle men;</hi> and assert, that the <hi>Scripture is most apt</hi> to settle and justifie in their way such persons, who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48783:47"/> though not so learned, yet in faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtingly rely upon it, and labour regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to walk by it. So indeed a <hi>Rule</hi> must justifie such as are <hi>rulable</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>Now to make good this upon Scriptures Rule, we shall resume that undeniable P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Infallibility and immutability of God is most apt to settle and justifie</hi> all <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of all sorts</hi> beleevingly relying on them.<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17, 18.</note>
                  <hi>But the Scripture hath the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and immutability of God revealed</hi> in it, and annexed to it; therefore, is it most apt to settle and justifie all persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtingly by Faith relying on it.

Now is it our work to disprove the Authors reasoning against Scriptures fitness, as he giveth it in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond section.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is suggested, No man is justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for assent or practise of any thing, of which either by <hi>common-sense</hi> or some <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion</hi> they cannot take to be true; but these unlearned persons proceeding undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, have no occasion to <hi>reflect,</hi> nothing then can justifie them, but Principles of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-sense;</hi> but by this they have no self-assurance of <hi>Scriptures letter, being utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, when it was writ, by whom, how brought down, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Scriptures letter is not our Rule, that can justifie any without its sence; upon which false ground he still proceeds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. None ought to be so unlearned as to be utterly ignorant of the Scriptures to be Gods word, it having been alwaies a Principle received in the Church; nor undoubtingly to proceed upon such igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in their presumptions.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:48783:48"/>3. They that know not letters, nor can read the <hi>letter of Scripture,</hi> yet may know the <hi>sence and meaning</hi> of God in it savingly, being taught by sound Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition, not Popish delusion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not necessary for their justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they must know, when and by whom the Scriptures letter was writ: If they receive Gods revelation therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevingly, (which by the light of nature only they cannot do, but with the help of the spirit) and walk regularly thereby, God by his Scripture will justifie them. But for grosly ignorant, and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones who do not attain to Scriptures Rule but abuse it; The Rule cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie but condemn them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He suggesteth this, to invalidate Scriptures aptness to justifie its follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; That these unlearned, and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ones, may depen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Neither can their uncultivated Reason give them knowledge this way of the goodness of Christian Doctrine; and its p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now what is all this to weaken Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aptness for justifying its Followers.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48783:49"/>1. Suppose these unlearned do depend upon their Teachers abilities, and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they have nothing but sensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by eies and ears to judge of them, and an uncultivated reason uncapable of such skills pretended by their Teachers. The proper issue must be, that they make this skill of their leaders to be their Rule, which cannot justifie those, who know not, what those skills do mean, and yet depend upon them. These may be more to blame, than those who trust Artists, when they see their work. But herein the <hi>Discourser,</hi> as well as elsewhere seems to make Christian Religion too much like a <hi>Mechanical Trade</hi> to be hammered out by sensation, which yet is known in the Church to be of a Higher Extract and to be taught from heaven though entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and helpt on to practise by sense and reason. In summe, all the hurt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded must fall upon the Teachers skill, and the Disciples ignorance, the Scripture of God cannot justly be blamed here. Put we this case;<note place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> the Beraeans heard the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle preach, and were convinced of the Truth of Jesus, and received it; Yet they had no cognisance of <hi>Pauls</hi> skill and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning further than as he opened the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48783:49"/> finding them concordant thereunto, they received the word with all readiness of mind; whereby they were not only ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified but commended to be noble souls above many. Had they depended upon mans skill, they might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Let the Author look into this glass, and condemn his unlearned foolish ones, but justifie the Scriptures of God, which justifieth beleevers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. His main suggestion is, that many Professions pretending to Scripture, differ, damn, condemn and perhaps persecute one another; Now these vulgar, unlearned ones being unable to judge which is most to be trusted, their sense brings them to an inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable blunder; They have so much reason, which tells them there is but <hi>one Truth;</hi> but these honest Schollars of down-right Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of her lowest form, being unable to judge which truly follow the Scriptures letter, cannot be justifiable by Scripture for following it under any party. Therefore it must be meerly for <hi>want of Light</hi> or evidence in the Directive Power of the Rule. This properly then is not competent to Scriptures letter.</p>
               <p>We contend not for Scriptures letter, without its sence or spirit, which we must urge as often as the Discourser argueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the letter only. But to this main stumbling block, that we may remove it, we shall reply in these particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48783:50"/>1. It is to be granted and lamented, that there have been and are so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The dissentions of Professors about <hi>Scripture,</hi> or about <hi>Christ</hi> himself, argue not <hi>want of light</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> or in the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> For the Son of God revealed in them is the <hi>light</hi> of the world unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but they may note blindness in them who so much differ thorough unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, ignorance, and perverseness: who are no more fit to discourse of the things of God, than blind men of Colours: and we suppose no seeing man will be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if they differ in their judgments, who cannot sensibly know them, and believe his own senses.</p>
               <p n="3">3. These honest Schollars of downright Nature, and of her lower Form; seeing they have so much reason (so the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser grants) as will tell them there is

               <p n="1">1. Unto this, we say; It is needful to open terms, before any thing can justly be denied or granted: The greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is about the <hi>Subject,</hi> to whom the satisfaction must be given: The Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser calls them Sceptical Dissenters, and Rational Doubters; whom he describes to be <hi>Thoughtful men,</hi> calling <hi>things to a strict account, before they yield over their Assent;</hi> Therefore nothing less than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration can bind those Active vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile souls from hovering in doubts, when their Eternal good is concerned. We must ask him before we proceed. Are these rational Doubters within the Church, or without it: If within Scripture, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are fit to use to them; But if without, they are Infidels uncapable of Scripture reasonings; <hi>These</hi> Scepticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Naturalists are professed Enemies to knowledge, and will not yield to Scienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical <hi>Mediums,</hi> neither will demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons though Divine satisfie them: And in truth as the Apostle stiles them, they are

                  <hi>having no Faith:</hi> These then are no Subjects rulable by the Rule of Faith, and therefore is it not proper to the Rule to satisfie them. Hence then in this sence we deny the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position as untrue. Yet if it be meant of rational Doubters indeed within the Church and not Heretical Apostates, The Scripture is fully able to satisfie their doubts about the doctrine of Christ; and in this sence we grant the Proposition, and deny the Assumption: And this must rest upon proof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We still distinguish between the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> which only concerns them under it; and the <hi>Means to Faith</hi> which respecteth others. Now to satisfie these Scep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>icks; Other Arguments must be made use of to perswade them of the necessity of the doctrine of Christ and Truth of it, <hi>before</hi> Scripture Authority is imposed on them, such the Apostle useth to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> and <hi>Roman Gentiles</hi> convincing them by their own light of their own lost condition;<note place="margin">Acts 17. Rom. 1.</note> and the necessity of seeking righteousness in another unto salvation. If these prevail, then Scripture-Revelation will be effectual to convince of this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to be had in Christ Jesus; as some of those Dissenters found.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To discharge this objection, in those captious suggestions about indeavouring to demonstrate to these <hi>Scepticks</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48783:53"/> of Scriptures letter, reconciling seeming contradictions, stating number of books, Original, Translations to be true, and the sence of them to be sure, (as ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Sect. 3.) Yet these persons are left in suspence, with a <hi>why might it not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise?</hi> smiling at their indeavours, who labour by these to perswade them to the Rule of Scriptures letter: We shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly give answer in these <hi>P.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Excepting still, that we urge not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures letter unsenced upon any as the Rule of Faith, we say, it is incongruous, in winning these <hi>gentile wits</hi> to the Doctrine of Christ, to begin with Scripture demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards them; It is likely they will smile at such Indeavours, and abide still in suspence about it. The proper work with them is to convince them of their sinfulness, brutishness, and ignorance of the way of salvation by such Principles as the light of nature must grant; though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clouded with lust in some it will not. If by this means these persons may be shamed and humbled, and taken off from their proud conceits in vilifying the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God, then may Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration somewhat prevail, and satisfie: but if men be perverse, they will flout at the strongest reason, so some of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> did at <hi>Pauls</hi> discourse. But all this concerns only the means of bringing men to the Faith, which is no Rule of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48783:53"/>2. The Rule of Faith is in correlation with those who are ruled by it; therefore it is just that it should be able to satisfie the reasonable doubts of them, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to be ruled by it: but is it therefore to satisfie the sophistical ventilations of Sceptical d ssenters from it? As good reason is it, that the Carpenters Rule should direct and satisfie the Apothecary in ordering his Medicines.<note place="margin">1 Cor 2.14.</note> If the natural man cannot discern spiritual things (such as is the Rule of Faith) much less can or will those Opinionative dissenting Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks discern or entertain them. Is God bound to satisfie these? no more is his Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the Subjects in this Case be sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted capable of satisfaction from the Rule of faith, that is, such believers, as may be apt to doubt of the doctrine of Christ from weakness and not from wickedness, the Scripture is most able to satisfie all their haesitations and doubts, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the sum of the Covenant of grace, is set up purposely to resolve and drive out all doubts concerning Christ. So the Apostle determineth.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.6, 7, 8, 9.</note> Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven, that is, to bring down Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is as if he had said, doubt not, reason not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly in your spirit about Christ. The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and heart, that is, the word of faith, which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48783:54"/> we preach, and now I wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te of unto you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is your satisfying and settling Rule. Whence we conclude, it is no such wearisome or tedious way to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of doubts by the Scripture to them, who humbly seek it: but that it is easily victorious by reason of its certainty and infallibility over the shock of doubts, and assaults of intellectual fears. In this, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both in the letter and spirit of it, is not defective, but compleat; therefore by this property also is it the Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the fourth Section he undertakes to prove the fifth Property, which he assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Rule of Faith, to be incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to Scripture. His arguing must be thus. <hi>The Rule of Faith must be Convictive of the most obstinate and acute Adversaries to it.</hi> But, <hi>The Scriptures letter is not so.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, It cannot be the Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is taken for granted by the Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser and the Assumption only he indeavours to make good to the end of this discourse in all the sections following.</p>
               <p>Before we deny or grant, or disprove any of his Objections we must examine terms.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the proposition, the <hi>Affection</hi> attr buted to the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> is to be <hi>Convictive,</hi> which term may be understood of <hi>Convictive Virtually,</hi> or <hi>Convictive actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:48783:54"/>2. These <hi>Adversaries</hi> are considerable, whether they be in the Church or out of it; For this Discourser argueth also against Scripture, and yet he takes himself to be in the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scriptures letter we admit not without its sence, which still he obtrudes upon us. Now these considered, we say.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Rule of Faith must have Convictive Power to answer all Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries against it; So we grant the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Rule of Faith is not bound <hi>de Facto</hi> to be Convictive of such obstinate and acute Adversaries; So we deny it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Scripture in the Letter and sence of it, is all-sufficient to convince all reason though obstinately adverse to it of the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y of Gods salvation by his Christ. For the reason of it is strong, even Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and the Truth of it infallible; why then should it not convince?</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is perverseness in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser to require this in Scriptures-letter unsenced; We assert Scripture fully: and hereupon deny his Assumption; We shall try his proof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He brings in the Adversary persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the Notion of a <hi>Deist</hi> making his obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctions. He imagins some Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture quoted to convince him of some point, (suppose) of Faith. He asks how you are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48783:55"/> sure that it is the word of God? You al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Excellencies of it: And the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser</hi> indeed doth grant it, so farre, that eies enlightened by true Faith, may discern something in it above nature, and cry <hi>Digi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Dei est hic:</hi> But this <hi>Deist</hi> will answer that many parts of this book of God, are indeed very excellently good; but that the Devil can transform himself into an Angel of Light, and therefore, it may be his book, as well as Gods. This is the scope of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bring the Scriptures into suspicion, that it may be the Devils book and not Gods; and so all the Excellencies of it to be the Issues of the Father of lies.</p>
               <p>Unto this we reply</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a most odious suggestion, which he being a Professed Christian; puts into the mouth of his <hi>Deist,</hi> (that otherwise might never have entred into his thoughts) that the Devil should be the Author of Scripture; Just like him, who speaking of the Souldiers delusive Apologie, that his disciples stole Christ away while they slept, (infused into them by large hire from the Rulers to obscure Christs Resurrection) said, What fools were they? could not they have said rather. that the Devil had taken him away? This might have salved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and put the Assertours of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection to a farther trouble of proving it: And so the <hi>Speaker</hi> left it. No less
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48783:55"/> doth this <hi>Discourser</hi> in favour to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, make this objection, and so leave it. Yet we shall not leave him so in this case; but return as the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the <hi>Eternal word</hi> of the Father unto the Pharisees, when they charged him to cast out Devils by the Prince of Devils;<note place="margin">Mat. 12.26.</note> If Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself; How shall then his Kingdome stand?

No just cause therefore is there to object that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as transforming himself into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, might be the Author of Scriptures Excellencies; for it is the bane of his Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may inquire into this new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Person the <hi>Deist,</hi> stiled before the most obstinate and acute Adversary; who and what he is? Whether a subject, fit for the Rule of Faith to deal withall? The notion seems to hint a person who grants a <hi>God,</hi> that is <hi>in Abstracto;</hi> That there is such a <hi>First Being</hi> called <hi>God;</hi> and this is all, but denieth him in <hi>Concreto,</hi> that is, to be <hi>such a One</hi> as he hath revealed himself to be in <hi>word and works:</hi> which in Gods account is a meer Atheist, who acknowledgeth not God to be such as in his Covenant he hath made known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note>

               <p n="3">3. It is no impeachment of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Excellency and convictive power; though blind men see it not,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.3.</note> and perverse men will not be convinced by it: If the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them who are lost, and they perish by their wilful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate blindness: God and his word are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in this case. And though they will not acknowledge Gods power in his word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, yet they will confess in the sad issue of unbelief, <hi>Digitus Dei est hic.</hi> The hand of Gods vengeance is hence come upon them.</p>

                  </gap>kes his <hi>Deist</hi> to requite the Excellencies of Scripture with many strange <hi>Absurdities,</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> (as he saith) by the <hi>Protestants</hi> own confession, lying in the open letter of Scripture most unworthy of God, as that he hath hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He finds Texts against acknowledged Science, and reckons up a multitude of Contradictions therein▪ which are such in their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In reply to this passage.</p>

It's true, that <hi>Absurd, Heretical, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi> disputers have by their sences made <hi>absurdities, and heresies, and contradictions,</hi> in the letter of Scripture, but God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered no such things in that written let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unworthy of himself however he hath condescended to speak to us of himself after the manner of men: His sence is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the letter with the Sun-beam, though blind men see it not. What though those <hi>sottish, carnal Anthropomorphits,</hi> read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such passages in Scripture, where <hi>hands, eies, nostrils, love, Anger and passions,</hi> are spoken of God, do foolishly phansie him, as a <hi>Man?</hi> Doth this conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Scripture, as if it taught men to think so of God? or doth it not condemn the beastliness of men so to abuse Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and <hi>Metamorphose</hi> God into a <hi>Man?</hi> We know <hi>Eies and Ears &amp;c.</hi> are <hi>figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and metaphorical</hi> expressions of the <hi>Providence and Government of God</hi> in the world; and the sence of figures is the proper meaning of any thing which they represent. It were good that the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser would perswade his <hi>Deist</hi> (who perhaps is himself,) to be more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in arguing against Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny that there is any thing in Scripture against acknowledged Science,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48783:57"/> but against that which is so falsly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Contradictions real in Scripture there are none, but such as Corrupt Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have feigned. Those then weaken not Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We do not abandon <hi>Scripture</hi> as our <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> when we say there are no Contradictions therein, but seeming ones to <hi>bad-sighted men:</hi> We confess no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies to be in the open letter, nor any Antecedent knowledge to be our <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> but the <hi>will of God alone</hi> revealed in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> True it is that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Education, and honest Tradition, were means to bring us to understand the Scripture which is our <hi>Rule,</hi> but that means is not the <hi>Rule it self.</hi> Let the <hi>Deist</hi> consider this: or let him answer a Quaere in a common case; The Carpenter being about to bring his Boy to the use of his Rule, informeth him of the <hi>Inches, half-feet,</hi> and <hi>feet,</hi> with other lines and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures contained in his Rule; is his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of those things prerequired to the right use of the <hi>Rule,</hi> become the <hi>Rule it self?</hi> His sence and reason will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to say so in this Case to men: however he is sharply set to dispute more unreasonably against God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He puts into the mouth of his <hi>Deist</hi> all the former objections of his <hi>Sceptick</hi> to be more obstinately and acutely urged: As,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48783:57"/>1. If ye answer those passages, which give hands <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to God, by other Scriptures controlling them. He tells you, then ye hold both parts of a Contradiction, which is absurd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If ye recurr to reason or Science, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that God is immutable, a Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He replyeth, Science then is your Rule, and not Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If ye say ye relye on your Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, or Pastours skill, then their skill of which ye cannot judge, was your rule, or else ye must come to <hi>Tradition,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert your <hi>letter-Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He challengeth you, that ye bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with you thoughts by which ye inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture, and to which ye will hold; and so you make the Scripture a <hi>thing ruled,</hi> but not a <hi>Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. He asks this smart question, how ye are certain of the truth of the letter in the Text, or whether it be not foisted in, or some way altered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as leaving out such a particle as <hi>(Not)</hi> which will turn a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into an affirmative.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you reply, Consent of Copies, he saith all may be alike faulty; That other Scriptures might be, not come to knowledge; In short, that Copies, Translations, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of readings are full of uncertainty: Nay the last, so many in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>Bishop Ʋsher</hi> durst not print them for fear of bringing the whole book into
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48783:58"/> doubt. If you say that the Faith of Christ was taught from Father to Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He challenges you, to desert your own Rule, and imbrace Tradition, the Rule of Roman Catholicks; in fine, without this Error, might creep into the Text in substantial points of Faith, which devolves into this; That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-letter held forth as a Rule of Faith, can never convince an obstinate and acute Adversary.</p>
               <p>To these many words, we shall return these few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Discourser doth but <hi>Cramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en recoquere,</hi> that is needlesly, and unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorily reiterate, what he made his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick speak; only he may suppose it more obstinately and acutely done by his <hi>Deist,</hi> whom he hath armed for this purpose.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He concludes nothing but against <hi>Scriptures letter</hi> unsenced; which never any Protestant (unless wild) did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it self to be the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> but as expressing Gods will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Figurative expressions of God, and proper discoveries of him are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory; therefore he that opens the one by the other, is farre enough from holding both parts of a Contradiction, as is fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not acutely suggested.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We acknowledge the Exercise of reason and Science needful requisits, and useful means under the teaching of Gods spirit, to understand the Rule of Faith
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48783:58"/> delivered in the Scripture, but this means is not the <hi>Rule</hi> it self.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Protestants never denied, but strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asserted the necessary use of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers teaching their children the Law of the Lord; and so, honest and faithful Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be an appointed means to bring to the knowledge of the Rule of Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scripture: Nevertheless they grant not any Tradition Oral or Scriptural to be the Rule it self; much less <hi>Popish Tradition</hi> which is the Rule of <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks:</hi> but have proved it to be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and Apostate from the Faith of Christ.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is a foolish challenge, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants bring forestalled thoughts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to interpret Scripture to their own wills, and so make it a thing <hi>Ruled,</hi> but not a <hi>Rule.</hi> For Scripture by its innate sence held out, forms their thoughts as the Soveraign Rule to square them by; So their thoughts are ruled by it, and they are not the Rule of that.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As to his smart question, We shall mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return, it hath been answered already; Gods Providence hath kept his own writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Oracles in his Church from time to time. And to avoid prolixity, we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this <hi>Deist</hi> to peruse the Protestant Assertours of Scriptures Truth; who have rationally and firmly confuted all these Jesuitical quirks about the Originals, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48783:59"/> and various readings of Scripture. If he be not obstinate to destruction he may receive satisfaction from them, slips or omissions of a tittle or term may be by the oscitancy of some, (worthy of sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est censure) but this is curable by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring with others. But as to what is charged upon that <hi>Admirable Man, Bishop Ʋsher,</hi> we must suspend our giving credit to the testimony of this personated <hi>Deist.</hi> He might well suspect, what use the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Adversaries of Gods word might make of the various readings; but feared not the shaking of the Authority of the New Testament thereby, or of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Scripture-Truth by the same.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It seems all this while, that this <hi>Deist is a Roman Catholick;</hi> for were he <hi>one</hi> at large, he would be as obstinate to be perswaded to Christ by <hi>oral,</hi> as by <hi>written Tradition.</hi> Let us unsmask him then, and he is a Jesuitical Papist; who hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately enough oppugned the Scripture of God; but how accutely, let the wise Reader judge. Surely nothing hath been proved at all to enervate the power of <hi>Scripture Reason,</hi> as to the convincing of the most obstinate and acute Adversary of the necessity of Faith in Christ Jesus unto eternal Salvation. We shall therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow no further labour upon him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be obedient to the Apostles Rule: If any man consent not to the wholesome<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6, 3.4.5.</note>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:48783:59"/> words of our Lord Jesus Christ, he is a proud fool, knowing nothing, dotingly sick about questions, strifes of words, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the Truth; from these with-draw thy self. So we have done with the obstinate Opposer.</p>

               <head>THE Fourth Discourse EXAMINED.</head>
               <p>IN this fourth Discourse the Author strives to prove the two last Properties of the Rule of Faith, 6th. and 7th. incompetent to Scripture: <hi>Certainty in it self,</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainableness to us.</hi> The last of these he saith must stand or fall with the former; therefore he insists only upon the Rules cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in it self.

               </p>
               <p>In this Syllogism, we deny the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, although we grant not the proposition neither, but upon a due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48783:60"/> of the terms. It rests upon the Discourser to make proof against Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but the upshot of all his ventilation, is against the letter of Scripture only: His Title beareth it against the Scripture in its full comprehension; but his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is against the letter, which barely taken by it self, no Protestant ever held to be a Rule of Faith, but with its sence; and yet this Disputer will father this all along upon them as Assertors of it, and so labour to batter them. But it is all injurious and fallacious, unworthy of an ingenious Discourser. Yet let us see and consider how he acquits himself in this field.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He premiseth some distinctions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Scriptures letter; As that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, either <hi>Materially</hi> as such and such Characters, or <hi>Formally</hi> as significative of a determinate sence supposed to be Christs. Again, both of these are considerable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in its <hi>single self,</hi> or as dependention other helps or Causes on foot in the world. <hi>S.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>We shall animadvert a little here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed; The first distinction seemeth uncouth and strange to us, and unknown in any, unless Popish schools: That the <hi>Divisum,</hi> the thing divided, and the <hi>Membra dividentia,</hi> the parts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, should be every way one and the same: So it is here, The Scriptures-<hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:48783:60"/> is the <hi>Divisum,</hi> or thing divided; The <hi>Character,</hi> which is the very <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>Letter, and its significativeness</hi> or aptness to signifie, is an Affection indivisible from it: unless we make Scripture <hi>letter</hi> to be as insignificant dashes, and crooked lines, which new scriblers use to make. Indeed we know that Scripture as the <hi>integrum</hi> or <hi>whole</hi> hath been divided into, the <hi>letter</hi> as its <hi>matter;</hi> and the sence as its form, as into its due parts. This we grant, and what use the Discourser will make of his distinction, we shall consider though we grant it not as lawful: The Second is but a various acception of letter and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cativeness together, either in it self, or in dependence upon helps or causes of its preservation: we may note the use he makes of this also.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He applies his first distinction in Sect. the 2d. to this purpose by way of proof of his assumption; as is really implied; <hi>That which is lyable to be destroyed, as to be burnt, torn, blotted, worn out &amp;c. is not certain in it self to endure, and therefore not ascertainable unto us.</hi> But <hi>Scriptures letter being the Basis of its significativeness of Gods Sence is so liable to be destroyed; Therefore this cannot be certain in it self to endure,</hi> nor <hi>ascertainable unto us,</hi> and then no Rule of Faith, being so perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Whereunto the wise Disposition of Divine Providence is urged to back it; That he intending mans salvation, would not lay
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48783:61"/> it upon such weak means subject to perishing so many waies.</p>
               <p>As to this passage our reply is this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Discourser mistakes still his mark with us in disputing against Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures letter only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his complication of words is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity, when sometimes he calleth Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures letter the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> sometimes the means unto it: between which we have stated a great difference already, we grant Scriptures letter to be a means to Faith, but not the Rule of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We lay not the letter of Scripture, as the <hi>Basis</hi> of Gods sence, or <hi>Faiths Rule,</hi> but only as one special means of expressing it; Gods <hi>Arm</hi> alone is the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> upon which his revealed will or the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> is grounded; not perishable or al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erable Elements, as is causelesly suggested.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppose books, letters, characters, or Elements, that express the will of God should be destroyed, (which God never hitherto totally suffered) yet the word and will of God, the Rule of Faith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever:<note place="margin">Mat. 5 18. 1 Pet. 1 15.</note> Heaven and Earth may pass away, but not one jot or tittle of Gods law. The Almighty will secure and perpetuate it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is no impeachment of the glory of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vine Wisdome and Providence to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and bring about Mans salvation by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48783:61"/> weakest means and in themselves perisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but the greatest sublimation of it; therefore did God choose weak things not only to confound the mighty, but to bring about the most powerful effects in mans Salvation. So God is pleased, by the foolishness of writing his will, as well as preaching, to save them that beleeve: Upon which account the Apostle wrote to the Corinthians to whom he also prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21.27.</note> Words fail as much as letters or rather more speedily: Yet the Discourser will not deny, but that the wise disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Providence doth by <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> bring about salvation unto men. Let him weigh then, which is the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most lasting means, <hi>words</hi> or <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi> We do not slightly passe over, but most seriously consider, adore and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire divine Providence, who thus crosseth the wisdome of the world in effecting his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Hence he premiseth, that from these noblest pieces in nature in good reason we may hope for a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Constancy, than from any other, nay for a perfect unalterableness, and in conceiving truth an inerrableness, if due Circumstances be observed, which are two here noted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Due proposals to affect sense and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get natural knowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Due care to attend unto such proposals, when the impression of the objects is heeded, and the mind affected by it.</p>
               <p>In return to this passage.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We take for granted, that the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Characters spoken of, are the very letter of Scripture considered in the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of their preservation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We grant freely that the <hi>material means</hi> of preserving Scriptures-letter are liable to many alterations and contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as in hand-writing and printing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We say, that mens minds are <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mutable</hi> and corruptible notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>their physical Immateriality:</hi> Now this moral Corruption of mens minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangereth Truth most; therefore there is no such reason as is pretended, to hope for greater constancy from them, in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4, Mens minds are as deficient preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives of Scriptures-letter, as their hands, both by moral Corruption and obnoxious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to perpetual alteration through the alloy of their <hi>material compart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Notwithstanding the due proposal of object and due care to attend, there must be also a due disposition of the Subject, and means of bringing home, or impressing the object on the mind, to beget the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of any thing; and no less of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Though God make use of mans mind and hand as means to continue his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his Church, yet he himself alone is the efficient and preserving Cause of it, who will keep it from perishing.</p>
               <p>In the 4th Section he makes a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his premises.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Rule of Faith must be obvious to men of ordinary sense, not only to Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Objects of senses, are either <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> as <hi>simple</hi> vulgar actions, and matters of Fact, which being oft repeated, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistakable <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or <hi>compounded Actions,</hi> as the Transcribing a whole book consisting of such myriads of words <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it exceeds
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48783:63"/> humane ear, to keep awake and apply di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct attentions to every of those distinct actions. Yet he grants, that this defect may be provided against, by the care of many so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and sedulous Examiners who may ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the truth of the letter of a whole book u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereunto we shortly reply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Rule of Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to men of ordinary sense, in their own language and plainest way for their understanding; And no less ought these vulgar souls set themselves to apprehend the Rule of faith to salvation; therefore hath God given them reasonable souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. These souls are not bound to look over Transcribers and observe so many myriads of words, single letters, tittles and stops, no more then the Beraeans were, who searched the Scriptures given to them, without such excessive labour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whatever numerous multitude the <hi>Discourser</hi> requires to ascertain him of the truth of Scriptures letter; It satisfieth us, that God hath raised up his Instruments in all ages, both for number and weight sufficient to be his Competent witnesses of his written-Tuth; And what is Gods good pleasure in this matter, contents us, notwithstanding the Exactions of unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet we wonder, that the <hi>Discourser</hi> should trouble himself and his Readers,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48783:63"/> with recalling the certainty of Scriptures letters being; which was enough debated in the two first properties of evidence as to its existence; wherein these are coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: but we must follow him, as he leadeth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In this 5th. Sect. He applyeth his former Discourse to the matter in hand, which to contract, we shall form into this Argument. If it were certain that there had been such a multitude of Examiners of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures letter in each Copy taken from the first Original, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If by Excommunication or heavy Ecclesiastick Prohibitions, and Mulcts it had been provided for from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that none should presume to take a Copy of it, nor that permitted to be read, unless thus examined, then much might have been said for the certainty of Scriptures letter: but, no such order or exactness was ever found to be used, especially about the New Testament, therefore Scriptures letter may be uncertain in every tittle, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the diligence used <hi>de facto</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it uncorrupted. This is the sum, only he harps upon some doctrine of Christs writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in hearts, which he calls <hi>Tradition,</hi> whereby Scriptures letter may be ascertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; which he referrs to another place.</p>
               <p>Hereunto we orderly return.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No multitudes of men even the best, can give more assurance of Scriptures let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than a few, where God is the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48783:64"/> of it: Men by their crowds may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with men, as to gain humane Faith to any thing; but God himself by few or one witness is able to give certainty of his Truth, and work faith unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No Excommunications, Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Mulcts, either from Ecclesiastick or Civil powers, can keep mens hearts more upright, and faithful to their Trust, than the Almighties threatnings, venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and curse denounced against such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doers; therefore the Discourser may do well to consider, whose punishments are most likely to keep men upright, Gods or M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns: If Gods; he will see h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Consequence from mens Exactions is not firm, to give us more certainty of mens integrity in the present case; seeing Gods judgments <hi>de facto</hi> do not keep men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the Assumption, it is partly granted, that no such numbers, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness, as the Author captiously requires, may be found: but otherwise we deny it, and assert; that God hath alwaies maintained his number for this work to ascertain Scriptures-letter both in the old and new Testament: Whereupon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Romish adversaries are forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it to be the word of God, however this <hi>Disputer</hi> thinks by his <hi>paralogisms</hi> to delude the world.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:48783:64"/>4. From the premises we conclude, Scriptures letter cannot be uncertain in every title, seeing the Almighty Arm of God hath directed it, and by the faithful diligence of his witnesses conveied it unto us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As to his exceptions, that the more Copies make the more errors, and many Corrections to have passed over the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Edition, and still various readings make doubts, we answer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That is not justly to be charged upon Scripture, which is accidental to it, by some mens Oscitancies and Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, who orders even such evils of men to the manifestation of his own Truth, and the shame of lyars: This hurts us nor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The vulgar Edition, which the Trent-Confederacy, have Canonized, is the most corrupt of any, as hath been shewed by many witnesses: What impudence then is it for their Pope to injoin it to his Creatures, as the only Authentick Copy? As it is most current, so is it most Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently false.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Multitude of Copies do not corrupt Scripture but the multiplied faults of men, for which God will plead with them: Yet is there a sufficient Remedy also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this evill; by more careful inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faithful Instruments under Gods gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. These then are but reiterated cavils.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:48783:65"/>6. As to his close, That we will not have the sence of Christs Doctrine writ in hearts to be the Rule for Correcting of Scriptures letter, which writing he takes for his Tradition, and the help of it to ascertain Scriptures letter, he referrs to another enquiry, we say.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We acknowledge that Spirit-writing of Christs Law in hearts, to be a glorious saving work; beyond the Discoursers phansie of it here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny it in any measure to favour Popish Tradition, or to be a Rule of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure; for by this must hearts try, whether that be the same mind of Christ written in them as is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God: which will be declared, where the Author urgeth that Scripture for his ends.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We shall expect howsoever, what certainty will accrue to <hi>Scriptures letter</hi> from his <hi>Tradition,</hi> in the place where he shall offer it; and there consider it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In this Section he argueth against the 2d. thing proposed, which is <hi>Scriptures significativeness,</hi> Thus, <hi>Scriptures letter is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> therefore, <hi>the certainty of Scriptures significativeness is quite</hi> lost therein. This he exemplifieth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the vulgar, they have no <hi>Arts, Grammar, Logick, &amp;c.</hi> they are unable to compare places, and want Principles to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their Judgments therein.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:48783:65"/>2. In the wits of Protestants and Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans clash<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng against each other with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, about the great points of the B. Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Christs Divinity. The weak vulgar cannot attain the sence of Scripture: The strong and learned do not, for they differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: therefore Scriptures-letter is not certain in it self, and so cannot perform the office of the Rule of faith, to guide Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in their way to Faith, with a rational assuredness.</p>
               <p>In short to all this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We deny the Antecedent, and have proved the contrary, even the certainty of Scriptures-letter under the good hand of God, given and continued untill now <hi>de Facto,</hi> and which the same Providence will keep in being and duration: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Consequence is false, Scriptures significativeness is not lost upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the vulgar they have reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble souls, and thence <hi>natural Logick,</hi> which God required them to exercise for understanding his Law written; and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto them; unto which all that Mankind may attain through grace, and be saved by it, who do diligently attend on such Revelations of God; though they have no Arts or skils: as captiously are required by the Discourser: God requires not these but the former.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the clashing of witts among
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48783:66"/> the Orthodox and Socinians: one by Scripture affirming, and the other deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trinity, or Deity of Christ, This concludes not uncertainty in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures letter or sense; but infirmity, or worse, iniquity in men, who pervert the plain written word of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wisedome given to him wrote to the Hebrews; yet many unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unlearned, untaught of God, wrested his Epistles, as they did other Scriptures unto their own destruction. Were his Epistles or the Scriptures any whit the more uncertain in their letters or sense because of their perverse abuse of them? The Disputer dares not say so; and then let him answer himself.</p>
               <p n="4">4. These things being clear we infer, Scripture in letter and sence, is certain in its self, and so ascertainable to us, and therefore can perform the office of the Rule of Faith, to guide men in the true way of Faith, with a rational assuredness, who do sincerely and knowingly resign themselves to be ruled by it.</p>
               <p>In fine to this Discourse we remind the Author still, We maintain not the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-letter</hi> barely to be the Rule of Faith; but the Scr pture spirited and senced by God. This is the Protest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48783:66"/>
                  <hi>The Scripture of God in its integrity wants none of the forementioned properties belonging to the Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. In this last Section he dischargeth these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Apologie for himself, to keep him from being mistaken, as if in these Discourses he were an Enemy to Scripture; He telleth us therefore, that in a great part, he doth but argue as to man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He declares also, that he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth such Excellencies in those sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as would task the tongue of men and Angels to lay them forth: And in short that he contests with them only, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Scriptures-letter to be the Rule of Faith: which he supposeth is warranted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and their Successors, who went not with books in their hands to preach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Christs Doctrine, but with words in their mouths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this briefly we return.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Arguing against Truth only, as to man, will not render any excusable or g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iltless, when all the while he cordially disputes against God in his written word, which is true and Faithful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the Reverence he bears to those sacred Oracles, it is by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in another place with this <hi>proviso,</hi> that they be senced by his Tradition: otherwise he concludes them to be no words of God. And is not this great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48783:67"/> done to the Scripture, that mans Tradition should make it Divine Truth?</p>
               <p n="3">3. He professeth to contest with none but such as hold Scriptures-letter only unsenced to be the Rule of Faith: And who are they? Surely they are no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants: Let him not therefore falsly charge them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The instance of the Apostles will not help him; For though they went not with books in their hands to preach, yet both Christ himself read a written Text out of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 4.17.18, 19, 20. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>5.</note> and preached on it; And the Apostles also themselves urge constantly the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to make good their Doctrine of Christ: So that they were no Enemies to the right use of Scriptures-letter; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we. It had been to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if the <hi>Discourser</hi> had brought this Example to his own Priests and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elates with other idle Droans, to teach them to preach without book; and in that rational convincing way as the Apostles did: But this would spoil his Popish Cause.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next thing in his close is a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of others, whom he stileth <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters</hi> (suppose from his Tradition to the Scripture): These he saith put the Scriptures into the peoples hand to please them, and leave it to their Interpretation: So it is brought to the vilest contempt: This makes so many Sects in this our miserable Country,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48783:67"/> Country, that it is impossible to bring them under Ecclesistical or Temporal Government; and in sum, this Principle that the Scripture is the Rule of Faith is the necessary Parent of such ruinous and unredressable disorders.</p>
               <p>Here we have his Reverend thoughts of the Scripture, where his <hi>venom</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged against the word of God, and the Assertours of it: But it is a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true and malitious charge, whereunto it were answer abundantly sufficient, only to say, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee Satan:</hi> But yet we shall adde some things by way of reply in the words of soberness and Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no <hi>Revolt</hi> from <hi>lying Tradition</hi> to the <hi>Truth of God</hi> in Scripture, but a <hi>Conversion</hi> from Idols unto God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Scripture is the gift of God to his people, and Protestants dare not deny it to, or take it from, them; (as the Papal Powers exalting themselves above God most Antichristianly do) yet is it not left to every ones vain and private Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This is slanderous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Scripture being the Rule of Faith, wherever it ruleth, maketh souls most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and exactly obedient to <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>True Church-Government.</hi> It doth indeed oppugne the <hi>Tyrannical Hierarchy of Rome,</hi> and every thing that exalts it self against God: but it makes souls obedient to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48783:68"/> ordained of God and that for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake. This soul reproach the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors fore-fathers have charged on the Scripture, and he walketh in their steps: We shall only retort thus much in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Truth, that both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> have felt the sad and deadly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of their Traditionary Jesuitical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which the Scriptures of God and the lovers of them abhorre. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then Scriptures Rule of Faith is no Parent of ruinous and unredresseable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, but of the sweetest order, which followed, would work out most perfect peace in the Church and in the world:<note place="margin">Isai. 11.6, 7, 8, 9.</note> The wolf would dwell with the lamb <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Righteousness and Peace would then kisse each other, yea and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.

               <p>THis whole discourse contains two Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The opening of the Notion of <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ss.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp; 6. 2. The apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the premised Properties of the Rule unto <hi>Tradition</hi> and the conclusion from the whole. 1. Of the opening the term.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Entrance the <hi>Discourser</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that he had quite lost his labour in his former search for the Properties of the <hi>Rule of Faith in Scripture:</hi> Therefore, he will see, whether better hope may be to find them in his <hi>Oral</hi> or <hi>Practical Tradition,</hi> by which he meaneth, <hi>a delivery down from hand to hand of the Sence and Faith of Fore-fathers. Sect.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>To this, 1. We maintain, though, the Disputer have quite lost his labour (which he is willing to do) yet we have not lost ours in proving <hi>Scriptures All suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:48783:69"/> to be the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his frivolous and fallacious Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against it,—</p>
               <p n="2">2. We take his meaning, That <hi>Oral-Tradition,</hi> is a Delivery down from hand to hand, that is, by word and visible Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the sence and faith of his Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Where yet we note that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delivered by word is part of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for it is the delivery of such a thing even sence and faith of Fore-fathers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next Section, he illustrates his meaning of <hi>Tradition</hi> by a more express conceit of it in the nurturing of Children as to the knowledge of Natural, Civil, and Artificial things, <hi>S.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>All which without reiterating we easily grant; though it will not in all things fit so wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the conveying down of Faith as we may find hereafter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this Section, he saith, there wants nothing but to apply the same Method to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual affairs, and then may be gained a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and proper notion of <hi>Faith, Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, S.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>We shall therefore observe how we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it; if justly, we shall join issue, if not we shall declare our reasonable dissent, and shew the disproportion, which is not little between <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> things as to the knowledge of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He applyeth this to Christians Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and observeth.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:48783:69"/>1. They hear sounds, and have dim noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, Christ, Saviour, Heaven, and Hell <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Afterward according to capacities they are put upon some External Actions, deterred from sin, taught virtue; and to do some duties of prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They learn the Commandements, Creed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with Fore-fathers, they come to more knowledge: Then they atise a swarm of the same Religion, hold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng the same points with the former Age: And this comes on not by leaps from 100 years to a 100. but from mouth to mouth, and day to day, as young Eaglets made to see the sun by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in his full glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So these proceed from perceiving the dawning to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the common day-light of Christian Doctrine, <hi>S.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Whereunto, 1. We grant this to be a rational and natural help to bring up po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity to the knowledge and Faith of Christ and a means commanded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet we say also, that by the same means from Fathers to Children is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered down all false, superstitious, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Religion and all ungodliness and Profaneness. So that it is not peculiar to convey Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We except further, that this <hi>Oral-Tradition,</hi> is not hereupon the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> (which the Disputer is to prove) but only a partial help or means to nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture up Children from their infancy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48783:70"/> the knowledge of it, which is <hi>the will of God only,</hi> revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We animadvert that all this is only able to guide unto the external profession of Faith, but not without Grace to make true beleevers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He proceeds to prove this a real Truth; from the practise of the <hi>Primitive Faithful,</hi> before the books of Scripture were writ: and from the first imbuing of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts with Christian Principles: Nay he affirms that the very Presbyterians, much more the Protestants do adhere to their Faith, because their Parents and Pastors taught them: and not upon the Ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dence of Scriptures letter, He casts in the next place some reflexions on persons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that the Protestants owe all their union and strength to Tradition; and all their distractions and weakness to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of it, <hi>S.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>In short to this, 1. By <hi>Primitive faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> we suppose he means <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> in and immediately after Christs and the Apostles times; Had not these the Scriptures of the Prophets in that time? Did not they teach their Children from those Scriptures? was not <hi>Timothy</hi> taught those holy Scriptures? and was he not made wise by them unto salvation? they were not then before all Scripture was extant, nay some of the Churches then,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48783:70"/> had Epistles written from the Apostles: It seemeth this was not narrowly heeded by the Discourser.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No Protestants ever denied the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary use of Tradition of Truth unto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, but assert it as a duty Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God upon Parents to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to bring them unto Faith in the Revelation of God: and acknowledge, that they were at first so imbued with the Elements of true Christian Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3, Yet all true Protestants grown up to knowledge deny, that they adhere to the faith of Christ upon this account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Parents and Pastors taught them, but because now they find it to be indeed the true revealed will of God in his written word: of the truth whereof not their own private Interpretation; but the powerful wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k of Gods spirit by it upon their hearts perswadeth them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is something strange that this <hi>Disputer</hi> shoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> make <hi>Presbyterians and Protestants</hi> contradistinct members; unless he account the <hi>Episcopal</hi> order <hi>Protestants,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> scarce so much; and so cast in a bone of Contention between them: which savours not of Ingenuity. He cannot be ignorant that several of the Protestant Churches embrace <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government; And however others are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other forms, yet have they equally contended for the Protestant Faith against
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48783:71"/> Popish Errors: which doubtless they will do still.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a most unhandsome reflexion, upon those Persons whom he nameth, meerly to cast an <hi>odium</hi> on them, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more suspicious than others; when he desires from his Answerer more civil usage toward himself. He may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a mark also.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Protestants do owe their un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kness, they own unto sins among them: and specially to those who forsake the <hi>simplicity and unity of Gospel-written Truth</hi> to cleave unto the vain <hi>and unsavory Traditions of men.</hi> No more to this, but only a desire, that the <hi>Discourser</hi> would resolve this question, why are there so many Sects, orders, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions among the Papists, if Tradition be such a soveraign Cure, and all of them are professed subjects thereunto?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The nature of his Tradition being thus explained, it renders, as he saith, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny objections unnecessary to be answered or mentioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this <hi>Tradition</hi> may come from a kind of <hi>Prophetical Afflatus</hi> or <hi>Inspiration;</hi> it is only built upon perfect Evidence of their best senses.</p>
               <p n="2">2, That Protestants have taken a wrong aim, to dispute against <hi>Res traditae,</hi> the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48783:71"/>
                  <hi>things delivered,</hi> and so accuse Papists for holding humane Traditions, or things inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men for faith: whereas when they speak of the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> they mean by the word <hi>Tradition,</hi> only the <hi>Method</hi> of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly delivering and conveying down Tenets held to have come from Christ. <hi>S.</hi> 6. This is the sum of the first Head for opening Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>We perceive not yet, that <hi>Tradition explained</hi> by the Author rendreth many or any objections unnecessary to be answered or mentioned; whatever conceit he may have of his own Explanation; for it no way cleareth those two, which he himself here suggesteth. It is requisite therefore to ponder what he saith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Cannot his <hi>Tradition</hi> explained be truly charged to slow from some kind of Prophetical <hi>Afflatus</hi> or slashes of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Inspiration,</hi> because it is built upon perfect Evidence of their best senses? may not senses even the best be deluded? yea and be so bewitched by the Devil to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve lies? We must therefore, seeing he hath started it, deal with him about this objection, against his Tradition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We take it for granted, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng upon <hi>natural Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> his scope is to transfer all to his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Tradition,</hi> for which he only contends in all his discourses; when he speaks of the doctrine of Christ uninterruptedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48783:72"/> to his Romish Church thereby: and hereupon owns himself and Papists to be Traditionary Christians. But for him to argue from Tradition <hi>general</hi> to his own in <hi>special</hi> or from one kind of <hi>Tradition</hi> in the Church which is <hi>true,</hi> to another which is <hi>false,</hi> it is but fallacious, and will not be allowed him; we see him better, than to be so cheated by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We shall suggest unto him that ever since God had a Church in this world vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, there were therein, <hi>A seed after the flesh, and a seed after the Spirit.</hi> So it was between <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Now doubtless <hi>Cain</hi> by <hi>Tradition</hi> taught his Children his <hi>Faith</hi> of God, which made them <hi>Apostates</hi> from the Truth: and no less did <hi>Seth</hi> teach his Poster<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty by Tradition his <hi>Faith</hi> in God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by kept them to the true faith untill they mingled with the children of men and were corrupted so farre, that God took them away by the flood. Yet both these received their respective Traditions, upon the perfect Evidence of the best senses they had. Evidence of sense then, that this was delivered to them as from God, did not secure any of them from being deceived, but some higher power of the Lord guided the true seed in his way. So it was in <hi>Noahs</hi> Family. So in <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and so along unto <hi>Moses,</hi> and from him to <hi>Christ;</hi> who contended against the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48783:72"/> in the days of his Flesh, for nulling the written commands of God by their Tradition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To come neerer to him; after Christs ascending to glory, and the Apostles then surviving, there arose two parties in the Christian Church visible; The one sprung from the <hi>Mysterie of Godliness</hi> God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the flesh:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15.6. 2 Thes. 2.</note> The other spawned from the <hi>Mysterie of Iniquity.</hi> These both professed Christ, and doubtless by word of mouth taught him to their Children and Disciples; but the one purely and sincerely as the <hi>truth</hi> was in <hi>Jesus;</hi> and the other corruptly with those <hi>lyes and falsehoods</hi> which turned away many from the true faith of Christ, even in those times: and yet both these Disciples recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what was delivered of Christ unto them upon perfect Evidence of their best senses; but the one with sense and reason inlightned by Gods spirit; and the other with senses, the best they had, but fasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Devil, to beleeve lyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they loved not the Truth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To draw a little closer to him, we may thus put him to it: If his Popish Tradition did indesectively issue from the Church in the Apostles time, was it from them that issued from, and contended for the <hi>Mysterie of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? The first
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48783:73"/> we deny; for <hi>Tradition</hi> meerly <hi>Popish,</hi> is but from corrupt sences of men, added to the simple Truth of Jesus which he abhors, as <hi>Peters Prelacy, The Popes succession of him, the introducing of other Mediators,</hi> besides the Son o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The second is justly charged on them, that Popish Tradition is the great Apostasie from the Mysterie of Godliness; and so the design of perfecting the Mysterie of Iniquity in these latter daies: turning souls from the true Faith of Christ, unto lying vanities, and that by the hypocrisie of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers telling lyes unto their Children.

               <p n="1">1. In the 7th. Sect. he saith, that to <hi>be be Evident to all as to its Existence</hi> (which is the first Property) absolutely agrees to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: For this conveying Practical doctrines by best Senses, as Eies and Ears, and that by sounds daily heard, and Actions seen, is as Evident to all sorts as to its Existence, as to see and hear: So it may be insinuated into Vulgar and Children and Babes in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to affect them therewith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We would understand what the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser</hi> means by this Properties <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> agreeing to Tradition; If he mean <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertibly</hi> so that it agreeth to nothing else, we deny it: but if he mean only that it plainly or simply agreeth to it, we grant it; Vocal sounds are Ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dent to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence: So are letters and writing also unto such subjects as are capable of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We grant that <hi>Oral-Tradition</hi> doth reach more ages and capacities than <hi>Scripture doth,</hi> therefore hath God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to be used to our Children, as they may become capable of hearing, and observing: but still do we bind up this method to the matter, that is imported and conveid in it; that it be consonant to Gods revealed will in Scripture; and that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48783:75"/> reading also as well as hearing is as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and necessary for subjects capable, to bring them to know Christs Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We demand of him, whether practical doctrines conveied by this <hi>Tradition,</hi> be not <hi>Res Traditae,</hi> that is, matters delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this method? He cannot deny it? How then can he charge us with mistake, when we grant the method agreeable to Gods will for conveying his Truth, but deny their doctrins to be Christs which they give down this way. Popish Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in form and matter is peccant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We deny, that his common vulgar children, and much more Babes, are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Practical doctrines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced although they hear the sound of words: It would be a rare thing to shew such Babes as are affected with Doctrine: Many may hear the voice, and yet not receive the Doctrine, who are more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then his Vulgar are.</p>

               <p>Our Reply is 1.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48783:76"/> also Protestants convey their Principles unto their Children, which are the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Truths of God, or Christs true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. If therefore this Property agree to <hi>all Tradition;</hi> and not to that <hi>only</hi> which giveth out the knowledge of Christ; It is not worthy of the name of a <hi>Property,</hi> either of the means or <hi>Rule</hi> of faith, being common to all other things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Further we except, that bare <hi>Oral-Tradition,</hi> is not so much as a means to bring to faith of It self, but as it carrieth in it the Principles and Doctrine of Christ and therewith indeed it may bring to the knowledge of Christ. So that this is <hi>Res Tradita</hi> or the <hi>thing delivered,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Tradition cannot be so much as the means to bring to the faith of Christ. Concerning which this Disputer warneth us, that we mistake, if we aim at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Tradition. We grant Tradition by word of mouth to be a special way to faith, but no further then as it conveyeth the Truth of Christ. The Method with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the matter is a vain found.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the Ruling Power of Tradition, It may be <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>de Facto;</hi> So Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of falsehood may have actually a delusive power to lead to lies: Or it may be <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>de jure,</hi> which is <hi>reciprocal</hi> with the <hi>Tradition of Truth;</hi> This indeed hath a Ruling Power from God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Faith, and souls are bound to be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48783:77"/> obedient to it. But Popish Tradition hath no such Ruling Power; much less is it evident or evidenceable to any reasonable Enquirer; The <hi>Disputer</hi> therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes falsely and fallaciously, that this Property evidently agreeth to his Popish Tradition, because it agreeth to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Tradition of Gods Truth contradistinct to that. He must therefore reason better to gain Credit to his Rule.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the 9th and 10th <hi>Ss.</hi> he proceeds to apply his third Property of the Rule of Faith unto Tradition, which is, <hi>That it is apt to justifie unreflecting and undoubting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that they proceed rationally while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye upon it:</hi> This he saith is found exactly in Tradition.</p>
               <p>Concerning this we assert No Rule can justifie them as rationally proceeding in their relying on it, who irregularly use it, though it be the truest. Now that men should take any thing upon trust without reflecting on the matter delivered, or doubting of it in the least measure, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Oral</hi> or <hi>Scriptural Tradition,</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in matters of faith unto salvation, is unreasonable and brutish. For it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for reasonable Creatures both to reflect, and question matters of serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, (among which the matters of salvation are the greatest) before they beleeve them: whoever do otherwise, do
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48783:77"/> foolishly; neither are they justifiable in relying presumptuously on the best of Rules. No Tradition of Truth therefore doth actually or can justifie such kind of irregular believers. If Popish Tradition can do it, for which the Author pleads, it must be a Rule like themselves; and so Folly may justifie folly among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists; but otherwise it cannot justifie them before God or Men.</p>
               <p>Yet he goeth on to prove it and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move objections against it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is madness (as he saith) not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve great multitudes of knowers, if no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible reason be to doubt, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to deceive us. Now in his way of Tradition, all Deliverers or immediate Fore-fathers are knowers: As they who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately heard the Apostles who were taught and practised all requisite knowledge: of which it is impossible the rudest person should be ignorant, whoever had any effect of such a teaching wrought upon him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>S.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>We reply 1. We beleeve, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had the saving Effect from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles teaching wrought upon them, had all requisite knowledge to salvation, and accordingly practis'd it all their lives.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet all who heard the Apostles preach, were not such knowers, neither such practisers of their doctrine; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny turned Apostates and made shipwrack

This he illustrates by the proceedings of a Jury of the plainest high shooes in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact: and by the common course of the vulgar, in believing there were such a one as King <hi>James,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of which Tradition ascertains them, and not the Authority of any Statute-book <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whence he concludes the 3d condition of the Rule of Faith, is manifestly found agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Tradition.</p>
               <p>We return to all this that the objection stands in force, notwithstanding his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended answer to it; For the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, we shall reply unto parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have already proved that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> can and will justifie all them who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly rely upon it as a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> that is, such as upon due and serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of it, and a due reception of the

                  </gap>ngly pretend to cast themselves upon it, for this is rash presumption.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny not the help of true and Faithful Tradition, to shew us that the Scripture is the true word of God; but yet this Tradition, we acknowledge not needful to give us its sence, neither want we Popish Trad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ble is sufficiently known.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We say aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, that the sence of Scripture is insp red of God; and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; as all propositions uttered by men carry their sence in them: speaking or preaching may hold out that sence, but it giveth none to the propositions of Gods Truth</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith depending on this sence, is not relying on the judgments, Fancies or skils of men; but upon the plain revelation of God, in matters of salvation: And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is bound to exercise his reason, and grow to such abilities that he may d scern between Truth and falshood. Hereunto the most Vulgar should labour to attain; but spiritual sluggishness in themselves, and carelesness in their guides and teachers, causeth most to sit down in ignorance, and please themselves in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming on mercy, especially when they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48783:80"/> are taught that ignorance is the mother of Devotion. These are not justifiable by Scripture, nor by Tradition: but other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious souls are justified by God, however condemned by this Disputer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Senses and sensations are not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate means to take in Faith. These may judge of sights and sounds, but not of spiritual matters conveyed by them. The best understanding is required to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in these things, and that not only <hi>natural</hi> but <hi>Spiritual,</hi> which alone can receive these great things of God. Such beleevers than are not justifiable, who take in nothing of God but by their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and sensations. There is no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between these and faith; much less certainty of their reception of it: upon whose verdict yet in these matters the Discourser placeth his greatest stress and assuredness.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As to his Illustrations they blind the matters in hand, but give no light to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Jury of plain <hi>High-shooes</hi> judge only of matter of Fact by the sight of <hi>six witnesses;</hi> and yet they must proceed according to the Law too: but we are contending of matters of Faith, whereof sense is no judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His application is no way fit; when he saith, take away Tradition, (which he meaneth Popish) and all ground for
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48783:81"/>
                  <hi>certain sence fails</hi> us, either for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or even Letter of Scripture. The letter of Scripture is evidently testified by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition faithful before <hi>Papal Rome</hi> was built, and as to the sence and meaning of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is inspired, and self evidencing to faithful humble and industrious souls search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein without help of his Tradition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to his Method of knowing, that there were such a one as <hi>King James</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> we grant that by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the rudest may come to know there were such persons; without troubling them with statute-books. Yet suppose that Statute-books make no mention of any such King or Queen, or that History should not only be silent of them, but te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie that there were no such persons: wise men would stagger at it, and not believe you, however your vulgar Tradition give it out. Let us truly bring this home to our Case. The Discourser saith, that his Popish Tradition bringeth down the Faith of Christ: The Scripture (which neither he, nor his Fathers durst deny to be the word of God) is not only silent of many points which he calls Faith; but expresly contradicts them, what wise man will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his <hi>Tradition-Oral</hi> against <hi>Tradition Scriptural</hi> in these matters of Faith? His third Condition then agreeth not to his Tradition.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:48783:81"/>4. He advanceth his strength to make good his sixth Condition, and in doing this, he will evidently prove the fourth, fifth, and seventh also agreeing to his Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the 11th. 12th. 13th. 14th. <hi>Ss.</hi> We shall hear and try.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>Ss.</hi> 11. he layeth down some premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and from them concludeth. His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument intire and rightly formed is this. <hi>What is built on Immoveable grounds,</hi> or <hi>is certain in it self, hath in it wherewith to settle</hi> or <hi>satisfie the most piercing wits, convince the most obstinate Adversaries,</hi> and to <hi>ascertain us absolutely:</hi> but <hi>Scripture is not, and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is built on such certain grounds &amp;c.</hi> Therefore to this and not to that agree, those conditions. Other passages intervene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the premises and conclusion, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving animadversion.</p>
               <p>In this Argument. 1. We grant the Proposition as universally stated.</p>

We deny the assumption concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tradition,</hi> whether <hi>universally,</hi> or <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi> taken; For all Tradition is not built upon immoveable grounds, as all men know: Neither is Popish Tradition so certainly founded, for which the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser here only contends, however he hideth it under indefinite terms.

               <p n="3">3. They cannot therefore grant his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion for the certainty of his Popish Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be sufficiently consequent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He did foresee this, that more would be expected from him pretending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate <hi>Traditions certainty:</hi> Therefore he attempts it from intrinsecal <hi>Mediums:</hi> His argument is thus formed: <hi>That which hath for its Basis the best nature in the universe, even Mans, the Flower and End of the Rest, must needs be certain.

               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:48783:82"/>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Examen</hi> of this Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we deny both the Proposition, (For a Basis of the best nature created cannot give certainty unto faith for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) and the Assumption also, (For no Tradition especially Popish is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the best Nature) as will appear in the sequel. The conclusion then for Traditions certainty is not demonstrated from the premises. To clear the reason of our denial, we shall animadvert some things in the argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We must observe, that it is a very strange Man here presented, whose <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is the best <hi>Basis</hi> for Faiths Tradition: How not considered in his Moral part? Not a Man of <hi>Morals, good</hi> or <hi>bad?</hi> what, nor a Man conceived in his <hi>Intellectuals,</hi> as <hi>Ʋnderstanding,</hi> or <hi>not understanding?</hi> Is it only then a <hi>Man of Sense?</hi> And is his sensitive nature the best in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to be the foundation of Faiths cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty by Tradition? How much doth this lift a Man above a Beast? Hear and consider ye noble Christian Ingenies; Is this a man for Faith?</p>
               <p n="3">3. We assert every man from <hi>Adam</hi> equally infected with Original Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only in his <hi>Moral part</hi> and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, (as the Discourser fixeth it) but also in his <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Sensitive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> His <hi>reason, seeing, hearing, handling, &amp;c.</hi> are all as defective by original sin,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48783:83"/> as his <hi>disposition</hi> to moral good, which, we suppose, he meaneth by his <hi>Moral part.</hi> If in one therefore he is defective or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible, he is so in all: He hath not therefore the best nature in the universe, it being sinful.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We deny expresly that natures stroaks upon senses, can make direct impressions of knowledge unto Faith in any man: How many eies and ears, do receive sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible impressions by <hi>Scriptural and oral</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and yet never come to the true apprehension of the doctrine of Christ?</p>
               <p>This impression must be made by an Almighty arm, to make men beleeve. Yet we deny not, but that mans sense is helpful to his understanding in its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; therefore sights and sounds may be a good means to bring things heard and seen to the understanding: but matters of faith are proper objects of intellectual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, if we speak as men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We judge it a brutish assertion, that the <hi>sound</hi> of the <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> of Christs <hi>Doctrine</hi> to eies, or ears, should <hi>make</hi> such impressions of knowledge naturally and necessarily, as the affecting of senses, to feel heat, cold, pain, pleasure, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther material quality: For these are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to sense; but the matters of faith far above. Sense takes the sound not the Faith.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48783:83"/>6. We conclude, that neither is mans nature now the best in the Un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>verse since the fall; therefore not according to the <hi>Discoursers</hi> reason, a sufficient Basis for the Certainty of that Tradition, which by him is pretended to be the Rule of Faith. Man is the subject indeed of Faith in his fallen nature: But the Divine nature only is the <hi>Basis</hi> of his own will, which is truly the Rule of the Creatures faith in him, and through his grace the main impressing cause of the knowledge of his Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the souls of men, by means offered to sense and understanding for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. We infer further, That (suppose mans nature in general were the <hi>best</hi> in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,) yet the intire nature of man, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be either <hi>Basis or subject</hi> of <hi>Tradition Popish,</hi> unless all men naturally were <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> or <hi>Popish men.</hi> It is true, that it is a property adaequate to <hi>Man</hi> in his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to speak, and give out from reason <hi>Oral</hi>-Tradition; but it is not so appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to <hi>Man</hi> as <hi>Man</hi> to spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stake the mark, and miscarry in his Demonstration: Seeing falshood as well as Truth, and infidelity as well as Faith, may claim that interest in mans nature, to be as he calleth it, the <hi>Basis</hi> of it; for all are alike delivered down to Posterity by <hi>Mans Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi> And mans nature is equally a <hi>Basis</hi> to all, if to any.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To strengthen this <hi>Medium,</hi> he adds the frequent impressions of knowledge upon sense, many times every day: Nay more their lives are to be framed by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts they hear, and conformable examples they see: So that Faith comes clad in such plain matters of Fact, that the most stupid man living cannot possibly be ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>We must a little inquire into this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; for it seems very strange.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is this <hi>Tradition</hi> (spoken of) <hi>sine re tradita,</hi> without matter delivered? unto such only the Discourser did pretend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Then it is a voice, and nothing else, that hath such effectual operation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Faith; which is insipid and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is the reiteration of such a voice, (suppose) uttering precepts from God unto the sense of hearing 10000 times a day, able to impresse faith or knowledge there? Sense is not capable of it: nor mans voice able to effect it; they do but beat the air.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:48783:84"/>3. Are the lives of all the Traditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hearers and Seers conformed to precepts and examples, which they hear and see? or if not, Is it the duty of having their lives to be framed, sufficient to bring this Faith unto them, when it is not done? The Disputer (we suppose) will be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to affirm either of them. And is not this also to consider man as to his <hi>Moral part,</hi> when his life is supposed to be conformed to precepts and Examples? which consideration of Man he exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before, as not pertinent to his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration in the present Case.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is Faith comming clad in matters of Fact, sufficient of it self to cause true down-right Christian practise, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the most stupid Creatures with knowledge? If he affirm it, we deny it. The Arm of God only can do this.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Are the most stupid men living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Papists under an impossibility of being ignorant of Faith, by having their senses, eies, and ears so often affected with their oral, and practical Tradition? The palpable ignorance of thousands of those sottish Creatures, contradict such an Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the <hi>Sun:</hi> They may have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of grosse superstitions impressed on their senses that way, but not of true faith. And not only is it so with them; but to their shame also, may it be spoken, who among protestants, where they hear and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48783:85"/> see the true faith of Jesus preached and practised daily, do abide in multitudes ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the true faith of the Gospel. The Discoursers demonstration then is not firm for the certainty of his <hi>Tradition</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Basis;</hi> notwithstanding the most frequent reiteration of words and practise upon their senses.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He draweth us to compare, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty each Christian Fore-father hath of what he hath practis'd all his life with that which a sworn witness in Court hath of what he saw and heard but once, thence to multiply, these thus-qualified witnesses, to equal the vast total of Christianity; and then to invent what force in natures universe is comparable to this inerrability of Tradition. Whence with very great confidence he concludes, that men must cease to be men, and nature loose it self, and by overstraining crack her sinews sooner, than the vast Testification called Tradition can possibly be violated. It must therefore unerringly regulate and bring down faith to its followers; whose Basis is stronger than all material nature, that is, such a one as was fit for supreme wisedome to lay for faith, being so neer and necessary means to bring <hi>Mankind</hi> to his Beatitude.</p>
               <p>Great swelling words of vanity, here packt up together, do not scare us from a just reply to this pretended Auxiliary unto
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48783:85"/> his former Demonstration▪ we do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus answer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon comparing a Christian Fore-father with a sworn witness in Court, we find both alike subject to Error and obnoxious to mistakes; which is farr from inerrability avouched hence unto <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> For it is possible, that a sworn wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may mistake in sight and hearing; and then his confident swearing maketh the matter worse. No lesse a Fore-father called Christian, although he be certain of what he hath practised, yet all the while may be mistaken in the matter of Faith, which is true and saving, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof imbrace lying vanities and fansies, and deliver down the same for faith unto his Children: neither of these enforce an Infallibility. We ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to give much credit to a man swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the fear of God, and to an honest Fore-father, testifying what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived truely from Christ and practised; but neither of these are inerrable, nor their Testimony infallible. And besides we have just cause to suspect, the Fore-fathers intended by the <hi>Discourser</hi> to be no such witnesses as these.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We will multiply these thus quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied witnesses according to the just Rule of their multiplication, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48783:86"/> the Fore-father Christian, which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, must be a <hi>Papist,</hi> for no other Christianity doth he contend; therefore in multiplying as he desireth, it must be within the verge and compass of this Christianity, that we shall deal with him about a Testimony to his <hi>Tradition.</hi> We shall therefore to avoid all fallacious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in this matter, consider Tradition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As humane and natural.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As truly Christian and spiritual with respect to the matters delivered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As meerly Popish as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters singly given down by them as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists;</hi> and so we shall determine the matter in these Propositions, as to multiplying.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We shall multiply witnesses quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied concerning humane natural things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>vast Total of Mankind,</hi> and we determine, that their continued Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in these matters within their sphere, may carry much certainty in many things, proved every day by experience: but yet not in all things, within the compass of Nature; neither for all this is this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which concerns all Mankind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We will multiply the qualified wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of true Christian Doctrine descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Christ, unto the total of true Christianity, or of Christians indeed, be it great or small; and we conclude, that their Tradition, so farre as they follow

               <p n="1">1. This would have been no wonder in this <hi>Discourser,</hi> who elsewhere runs round in a circle between his <hi>Church and his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> proving them each by other, as Causes one of another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We will not neglect to remind him also of the answer already given upon that account; which may be enough for him to review.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We shall only adde, that if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer age do misbelieve, then they, who follow their Trad tion, must misbelieve
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48783:88"/> also: So that Tradition is as sure a rule of error and misbelief, as it is of Faith and Truth; so long as it is taken by it self ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly without the matter delivered in it. This is no singular property then for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be the Rule of Faith or means unto it, as he promiscuously calleth it. Where then appears yet the certainty of Tradition fit for the Rule of Faith? The Author therefore hath more to do, then to open terms and explicate the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for necessity lyeth on him to prove the certainty of his Tradition, which yet he hath not proved as to Faith.</p>

If they argue it must be from knowledge, this must be from things; the best thing is mans nature, and that is ingaged for the certainty of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But their proper task is to loose two notions, which perfect Identity binds (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi>) and to blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Truth, which the noon-daies Sun of self-evidence discovers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If bold Bravadoes or daring words will do it, surely the <hi>Discourser</hi> will bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Bell, and level all to his own Tradition; It is well we know words are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48783:88"/> but wind, and so let them blow over. Our work is to search the bottom of the matter, and weigh his reason.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may without offence inquire of this <hi>Discourser;</hi> Have his Scepticks no more but <hi>Caprichoes</hi> of fansie against his Tradition to suggest; and yet had they so many real and rational doubts against the Scripture of God? or, have the obstinate and acute Adversaries, not an Argument against his Tradition, but are put to such a strait as to loose those two notions, which perfect Identity binds; or all they can say must avail nothing? Or must we not complain, that the Disputer is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al? who could put so many doubts and objections into their mouths against the Scripture; and not one against his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. We leave it to his Ingenuity to consider: It is no fair dealing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us therefore suppose his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and obstinate Adversary urging thus against his Tradition, which possibly he may hear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The one moveth his doubts against Romish Tradition after this manner; Is there not much more fallibility, in what Popish Fore-fathers give to their children, than in that Testimony which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be written, and is his very word, as acknowledged by the Trent-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates themselves? Is it not possible that the Discoursers Father or Teacher
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48783:89"/> might delude him? and he be deluded by his Fore-father? and so thorough the Popish line, might they not all be seduced from Father to Child? How can the <hi>Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> know but that the Tradition of other Mediators besides Jesus Christ, might be from the Devil? And the Tradition of Righteousness by mens own good works added to Christs satisfaction, may fall under the Apostles <hi>Anathema?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1.8, 9.</note> If any, or an Angel from Heaven preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let it be accursed. Nay how can the Method of Popish Tradition be the Rule of Faith which delivereth down so many Fables and lyes; as <hi>Popes Supremacy, Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantion</hi> of bread into the flesh or humane nature of Christ, born of the blessed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, (a monstrous Chimaera) with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of such like absurdities? Who can acknowledge that Tradition, which giveth down such things to be the Rule of Faith? Sense and Reason do abhorre them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The obstinate and acute Adversary moreover will tell this <hi>Discourser</hi> more smartly; That <hi>Romish</hi> Tradition of faith by Popish Fore-fathers, is from the Devil; that its Rise was with the <hi>Mysterie of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity;</hi> that the Romish Church is <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Babylon the great, the Mother of Harlots;</hi> that <hi>the Pope is the Apocalyptical Beast and False Prophet,</hi> that <hi>Antichrist, and Son of Perdition;</hi> That by the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crysie of them who continually have told
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48783:89"/> lies in their Traditions, all spiritual fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, Idolatry, and Apostasie, have been conveied down to the present generation of Papists: yea and all this he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and will prove against them. Are all these doubts and objections only <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prichoes</hi> of Fansie, or <hi>Quirks</hi> of wit, or vain and groundless Oppositions? The Discourser may talk so, of that which he cannot answer. His <hi>Deist</hi> whom he brought in cavilling against the Faith of Scripture, hath much more to say against the Faith of his Tradition, would he but let him speak freely, but here he kept him silent, as if engaged unto his Cause.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Discourser say they mistake him, because he speaks only of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Tradition, not of the matters delivered; Surely he mistakes himself, for he pleads for the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> and Faith then must be ruled thereby, which is the matter delivered; to divide these is to separate unseparable things. Besides his Adversaries grant Oral-Tradition to be a means certainly conveying Truth and falshood: and therefore deny its appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation unto Faith. In summe they say, as <hi>Tradition</hi> is one <hi>means</hi> to convey <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith,</hi> so the matters delivered do specifie the <hi>Tradition</hi> to be good or <hi>bad:</hi> So that if such foul things be given down by his <hi>Method of Tradition,</hi> this also must be filthiness it self.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:48783:90"/>4. His Adversaries therefore see no such task incumbent on them as to loose those two notions which perfect Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty binds; for <hi>Tradition and Certainty</hi> are not so united; The noon-daies Sun would discover this to him, but that he is blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own self-conceit, hugging his new Invention. Let him injoy it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In <hi>S.</hi> 15. He gathers up from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises his general conclusion: Taking for granted, that all his seven Properties of the Rule of Faith, do peculiarly belong to his Tradition, and that they are incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to any Competitor, he concludes in his own Judgment thus, That, Tradition is the Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p>For a closing answer to this Discourse.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We deny that any of these Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as rightly understood, are proper to his <hi>Tradition,</hi> which is <hi>Popish;</hi> or that he hath in the least measure proved, or made it good. And this we leave to impartial Readers to judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We offer it to observation, that the highest Demonstration, which he hath attempted to give thus farre of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Property hath its strength only from <hi>Man,</hi> whose nature he stileth the best in the <hi>Vniverse:</hi> And yet at the best is but frail and wavering and perishing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to all other properties of an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er descent, and more necessary <hi>Ally</hi> to the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> he passeth them by, as not fit
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48783:90"/> to be considered in the present case, or not worthy it. Yet must he know that nothing can be the Rule of Faith without them. <hi>As Supremacy, Rectitude, Commensurateness</hi> with the matter ruled, <hi>and Indivisibility,</hi> that nothing can be taken from it, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it; we expect these to be <hi>reciprocal</hi> with that which is the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> if not, we shall not yield it so to be. These then and the rest being not so peculiar unto his Tradition, his main Conclusion is denied.</p>
               <p>Tradition is not the Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not general humane Tradition, for this medleth not with Faith at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not his special or Popish Tradition, for that falsifieth and corrupteth the true faith of the Gospel, as hath been hinted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not true Christian Oral-Tradition, as it notes only the <hi>mode</hi> of del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vering down faith, without <hi>the matter</hi> delivered, which is the <hi>will of God, the only Rule or Ground of Faith</hi> unto Salvation. What a due and necessary means God hath made it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get faith, hath been declared, and granted. The Discourser then may silence his boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, untill he acquit himself and his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition better. That he promiseth himself in the sequel by a fuller demonstration: we shall go on to try his performance.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In his preface he brings in some, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his former discourses: but withall questioning; Was this Tradition held to? Who beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n to desert that Rule? Whoever held to it? or Was it ever held to by any? <hi>Ss.</hi> 1.</p>

               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48783:91"/>
               <p>All this might have been better spared and the Discourser might have fallen close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Demonstration; which would have advantaged him more, and lesse bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his Readers with a multitude of needless words. We will not follow him at his Range, but shortly animadvert up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the special Heads. Commend his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses they who can: We shall onely reply to the Queres. Supposing Tradition twofold. 1. General of all things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Special of Faith. And these two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notions, either of the <hi>manner</hi> of delivery, or <hi>Matter</hi> delivered by it. And then we return to them thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. None did ever question, or doubt, but that alwaies by speech all things have been derived from the Fathers to the Children; neither could this ever be deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; by the law nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Considering this <hi>Mode</hi> of Tradition carrying in it matters of Faith, which here the <hi>Discourser</hi> owns as delivered by the Apostles, we say many did desert their Doctrine of Faith, while they survived; and all the continued deserters of the same Truth in all Ages since, are of the same stock.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They only held to the Apostles Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Faith by preaching, who kept close to the same doctrine written by them and to none besides it: and by such it was and is held unto at this day. <hi>S.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:48783:92"/>4. The Discourser hath not prov'd evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that <hi>Romish Tradition</hi> is a certain <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and Scripture not. His fallacious treating upon <hi>Tradition</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and Scriptures letter, are but <hi>sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less gingles;</hi> for neither is the one denied its due place, nor the other at all affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Protestants: Therefore are they not cast in their Cause, as he vainly cryeth out.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They assert true Tradition oral of Christs Doctrine in its true use; and prove that Papists have fallen from that Rule, by the undeniable effects of that Apostasie in Doctrines expresly contrary to that of Christs and his Apostles, maintained by them to this day; which is enough to make them blush and be ashamed; but that a <hi>Roman</hi> face is steeled against such modest reflexions. The matter delivered if evil, spoileth the method of delivering, be it never so good.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Discourser forgets himself to be an <hi>Adversary</hi> to, while he takes upon himself to be a Judge over Protestants; but to his Censure they reply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They do not in the least tacitely yeeld the Doctrine held by the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> to be of Faith, uninterruptedly come down from the Apostles, or that it was ever and is Christs Doctrine. They do openly and lowdly deny it; neither were ever any of their Jesuitical Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48783:92"/> able to disprove them. If so, let the Author produce them: We grant the derivat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh <hi>Oral-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> we abhorre as much as that abhors the Scripture of God. This is a foolish Censure then by the Disputer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They appeal to God against the blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their Consciences with glances of Fancy from private Interpretations of Gods word, or deafning their ears with false Ecchoes from those sacred Oracles, who is their righteous Judge, and will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Cause between Protestants and Papists: who they be that lye against God, and who that maintain his Truth, in his appointed time. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, the Discourser had need to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he must appear himself at the judgment seat of Christ, and be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judged, for all those hard and ungodly reproaches cast upon the Scriptures of God under pretence of honouring them. Woe be to them at that day who shall then be found guilty of drawing away souls from the faith of God manifested in the flesh unto other <hi>Daemon-Mediators</hi> by the hypocrisie of them who give down <hi>lying Traditions.</hi> Their Consciences will be found to have been seared with an hot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. Let him and his be afraid of this judgment, <hi>S.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:48783:93"/>7. In S. 3. It is hard to say what the <hi>Discourser</hi> aimeth at; for it may well be put in a Parenthesis as not necessary to this Discourse. Yet we shall say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no unreasonable expectation that the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> should both order its Followers, and oblige them not to desert it: So God hath established his Rule in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The goodness of our Saviour is not to found his Rule of Faith upon mans nature, but upon God himself, that it may be able to rule Souls unto life, and oblige them firmly unto Faith.</p>

It is no less the justice of the Lord to suffer an Efficacy of Delusion to go along with Popish Tradition, to spread that Religion under the name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Christian Doctrine was at first unanimously settled by the Apostles in the hearts of the Faithful in great multitude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That this Doctrine was firmly beleeved by them to be the way to Heaven, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48783:93"/> to it the way unto Damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That hopes of goods (as Heavenly) and Fears of harms, (as Damnation) strongly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, are the Causes of Actual Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the thing was feesible, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were bred to, was knowable by them.</hi> All this put as his <hi>Medium,</hi> his Conclusion is. That it followeth as certainly, a great Body of the first Believers, and After-faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in each Age, that is, from Age to Age, would continue to hold themselves and teach their Children, as themselves had been taught, that is that they should follow and stick to Tradition; as it doth, that a Cause put act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually causing, produceth its Effect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is somewhat an obscure way of Demonstration; It had been plainer and shorter to have given it in three proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so more easily might we have seen the strength of his conclusion: We shall to help the Readers more clearly to judge in this matter, contract it, and put it under view together. His conclusion pretended by him to be inferred is, <hi>The Indefectibleness or Actual indefectiveness of Tradition from Christ and his Apostles.</hi> (Suppose of the Romish Faith or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is gathered into a systeme by his Trent-Fathers, and is now received and practic'd by Papists) For this is the only thing contended for by him in all his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses: Otherwise that Oral-Tradition of humane concernments is from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48783:94"/> indefective actually and indefectible so long as mankind is in being on earth, must be yielded by all. His <hi>Medium</hi> to conclude this must be gathered out of his 4 grounds, or at least the proof of it: The whole together must be thus formed. <hi>That Doctrine of Faith, which was at first delivered by Christ and his Apostles, and firmly beleeved by all the Faithful in that Age, and willed and known by all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all succeeding Generations to this very Age, is actually Indefective from the time of Christ.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Traditional Doctrine of Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled in the Trent-Canons, and as now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved and practised in the bulk of it by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists at this day, is that which at first Christ delivered,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:48783:94"/>1. As to what he may conceive of proof lying in his grounds, we shall grant what is to be granted, which will avail him nothing; and except against the rest.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We grant that the sound of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Doctrine went into all the earth,<note place="margin">Rom, 10.18.</note> and their words to the end of the world. So also was the same delivered in their writings and Epistles; Each Tradition was of equal account with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We except that however they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this Doctrine to their ears and to their eies; yet they could not settle it in their hearts;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.3</note> for then no Apostates had been in those daies: This was a work for Gods spirit only. Neither indeed was this Gods way to propagate truth to others; for it was a secret work which none could know but such as had it. The means of conveying Gospel Doctrine must be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as preaching and writing, such as work upon senses, which the Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for under the notion of a <hi>Rule.</hi> It may be therefore perhaps his meaning, that those multitudes did learn the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Doctrine by heart, that is, without book, which best suiteth with his Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:48783:95"/>2. As to his second ground.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We grant it fully as concerning them, who were truly faithful, that they did beleeve Christs Doctrine to be the way to Heaven, and the deser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Yet we deny all them to be truly faithful, who professedly in the first and following times received this Doctrine; neither did hopes of Heaven nor fears of Hell ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This step then in the Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers <hi>Climax</hi> for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Demonstration is but feeble: And it doth concern him to study more seriously whether the Romish Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie took not rise from the worse and failing party then, which hath been char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and proved against them. His Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Tradition must then fail him, unless
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48783:95"/> it be from Apostate Professors in that Age</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to his next ground. 1. We grant that Hopes of Goods, and Fears of Harms, are objective Causes of actual will, and no more; for they move the will to chuse and to refuse.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We add further, that the strength of Application of these objects, whether in matters natural, or spiritual unto the will, must be to victory over all repulses, to actuate the will unto its office of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or refusing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in spiritual matters the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation must be made to mans will by the Arm of God, or else Heaven will never keep them close to the way of Truth, nor Hell, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deterr them from relinquishing it; nor actuate will to a regular choice or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. Now the Event in those first times plainly shews, that hopes of Heaven and fears of Hell, did not actuate the wills of beleevers to adhere to Christs saving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor terrifie them from relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing it; for many fell away, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the strength of those <hi>Motives,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not applyed by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God. Which being so, the <hi>Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> had need mind this role of his Ladder also, or else it will crack and not bear his Traditional Fore-fathers in bringing down his Traditionary faith to this Age: For he can never prove that their wills were acted by God upon thoughts of Heaven
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48783:96"/> or Hell to bring down the Truth of Christ unto their Posterity, seeing his <hi>Trent-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> contain so many falshoods contrary to the same.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To his last ground. 1. It may be yeelded, that it was in their power (God vouchsafing them natural understandings) to know literally the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, and yet not in their power to stand to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny neverthelesse that it was in the power of all those multitudes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended savingly to know the Doctrine of Christ, unless those onely who were taught of God, and upon whose wills his own Arm had made impression of his motives to keep them fixed to the truth of the Gospel. Now seeing there were so many deficient in saving knowledge both of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and latter times; It will be a very hard matter for the <hi>Discourser</hi> to draw out from these premised grounds, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conclusion of his Traditions <hi>Indefec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveness</hi> or <hi>Indefectibility,</hi> from the Truth of Christ, to the false Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day: <hi>Idem jungat vulpes &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geat hircos.</hi> The same <hi>wild Foxes then may coat, And milk the Romish Goat.</hi> Yet let us look forward and see what way he will make in clearing up the objections pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by himself.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:48783:96"/>3. He now cometh to satisfie objectors out of his foresight, and so he hopes to clear his Demonstration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He saith, <hi>The indisposition of the wills of beleeving Parents, by reason of Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> may be objected as a cause hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them from a faithful delivery of Christs Truth down unto their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Unto which he attempts to give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. <hi>S.</hi> 6. To avoid transcribing of words we shall animadvert upon his answer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we grant freely Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was intended to be an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that original malice, and an help to preserve mens minds and wills right and pure: For he was manifested to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the works of the Devil; of which that was the first and worst.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We doubt not,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.8.</note> but that the Gospel of the Son of God did heal the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of many to whom God applyed it by his special Grace: Therefore Christs wisdome is not questioned as if the means appointed by him were not fit to do the Effect. But when this <hi>Discourser</hi> minds us of many thousands of Martyrs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Confessors, who by the Power of this Doctrine overcame this inbred declivity of their wills; we may as justly remind him of so many millions, to whom the sound of it came, whose natures were never healed, nor w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lls rectified by it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48783:97"/> we deny that his Traditionary fore-fathers, as to his <hi>Trent-Doctrine,</hi> were such Martyrs and Confessors whose wills were so cured: And we leave it upon him to prove it,</p>
               <p n="3">3. We deny that this Doctrine of Christ was delivered by the best willed souls only by <hi>Oral,</hi> but also by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tradition, against both which neither the stratagems of the Devil, nor the gates of Hell did or could prevail.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We add that however weak the Disputer may think Original sin to be, yet it inclineth to all malignity against God, and Apostasie from the Truth of Christ: but much more when Parents are to be supposed to have improved that root of bitterness by bringing forth many bitter fruits in Actual sins, habituating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto backslidings from God; and then it will not be so hard for him to grant they might be so vicious as to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Children.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Although we are willing to think, no Parents should be so unnatural, to teach their children, what they think will damn them; Yet we shall offer to him some Experiments which are undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There have been Parents who have offered their children to the Devil; such therefore may be at this day. 2. Parents bewitched themselves, are most apt to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinate
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48783:97"/> their Children to idol-worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Father-theef usually teacheth his Son to be a Theef, though he knows the end will be the Gallows. When the blind do lead the blind, they will both fall into the ditch. Nay nothing is more evident, than that Parents bred up in superstitious and idolatrous waies, will force their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be of the same Religion, that if themselves be damned, they shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them. And to this efficacious delusion God hath given up them, who loved not his <hi>Scripture-Truth.</hi> No grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Example of it than in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. These things being thus stated, how hath the <hi>Discourser</hi> quitted himself of the first objection? The Tradition of <hi>Romish</hi> Faith is notwithstanding descended from minds and wills, not only not healed by the Gospel, but more perniciously infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wilfull and obstinate falshood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the written Truth of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next objection is, <hi>That the fickle nature of the will, may exempt her from the Law of Causes.</hi> Whereupon he makes some Queries, to which we shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We grant that <hi>good</hi> is the object of the will, and doth affect it when it is sufficiently applied: Natural good to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural will, and spiritual good to spiritual will.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:48783:98"/>2. We assert Temporal goods and harms, do more affect natural wills than all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: Experience sheweth it, men usually prefer temporal rewards before heaven, and fear bodily punishments more than hell; such wills are fickle.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His world of Beleevers we take for the multitude of his <hi>Popish Fore-fathers,</hi> and their wills were carried under blind, superstitious minds, to forsake the Truth of Christ, and so to seduce Posterity; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the loss of infinite goods, and gain of infinite Harms. Such wills are no Causes of conveying down the Truth of Christ. In all this nothing strengthens his demonstration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The last knot which he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is That the Objector doth <hi>fault the Application of these motives to the wills of his Traditionary Fore-fathers; and then their wills may fail in doing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir office.</hi> What his reply is, we shall weigh and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>The Discourser may put his Teeth and nails to untye this knot, and all to no purpose; For that which is a sufficient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of these spiritual motives to mens wills, so as to make them faithful in giving down Truth, must needs convert them, and make them of flesh, spirit. Now all applications from humane strength are not able to change mans will; It must be Gods arm alone, that can so effectually
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48783:98"/> apply the foresaid motives. Leaving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Reflection upon pursuit of ends proposed by undoubted Authority, and his needless illustrations of it by a King preparing for Expedition, or a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man travelling to <hi>Rome,</hi> we fall upon his proof of a sufficient application of these motives, which we find to be mostly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and only his last instance any whit ingaging God; To all he urgeth we thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. VVe observe, he gathers his suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of application from humane means, which we deny to be sufficient to actuate mans will into regular working; and this in 5 particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The proposal of <hi>Gods supremely-fallible veracity</hi> from man to man, is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to turn the will truly to close with Truth; for then it would have been done upon all that heard Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles preach it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The representation of these infinite goods by most familiar <hi>Metaphors, venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacraments or the spectable Majesty of Ceremonies</hi> (nay of <hi>Romish</hi> themselves) is no sufficient application to move the will to close with the Truth of Christ. These are weak operatives from men when they are true; but pernicious when adulterate as in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48783:99"/>3. The Applications of these goods in the <hi>Visibility of the words being made flesh,</hi> was not sufficient to change mens wills unto the choice of Truth; for then all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom he Tabernacled, would have chosen him and cleaved to him. Unless the <hi>Discourser</hi> think the setting of him forth by <hi>Crucifixes</hi> or <hi>Popish Pageantry</hi> may do more; which is some of the spawn of his Tradition. These turn hearts to Satan.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Application of these goods by Examples in course of life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and outward shews, is not sufficient to turn wills unto the truth of Christ. Long experience makes this good. Indeed if the misteries of God were <hi>mechanical</hi> and <hi>maniable</hi> (as he makes them) he might have hope to make many of that Trade. It may be so with Papists.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All the frequent and efficacious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication <hi>of these eternal goods and harms by Education under Parents and by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and oeconomy of the Church is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to change wills to God: It was not so to all under the Apostles government, it was less in after ages; but not at all in that</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church, for which the <hi>Discourser</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; nay they harden wills against God. In all these he hath not cured the faulting of his Application. The knot is made faster.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:48783:99"/>6. In the last place he offers something worth consideration indeed, if he could prove it to his purpose, <hi>Christianity urg'd to execution, gives its Followers a new life, and a new nature; than which a neerer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication cannot be imagin'd.</hi> This is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication sufficient indeed of these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the regeneration of men; for this must change the will: but none can so urge Doctrine, but God himself. Yet if this be made serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ceable to the mans turn, he must prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Doctrine preacht by the Apostles with urgency, did give a new life to all their professed followers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the multitudes thus regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apostles, did give this new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r followers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That these also did give a new life by their Doctrine to the Generation Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and so successively to all the fore-fathers of him and Papists unto this day. But all yours is false; and impossible to be made good. For the huge gulf made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Apostles doctrine and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Popish doctrine with their application, will never suffer this to arise from that, or consist with it. The Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of several Centuries concerning the wicked doctrins and beastly lives both of Popes and Papists, will sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, that Christian Doctrine was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so applyed to them, as to make them
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48783:100"/> new creatures. If this Tradition hath, it must needs send forth sad swarms or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of such Christians among them to the worlds end.

However we will be no Umpires between them. Let them make good their Authority one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

He asserts, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wrought by these assistances, in his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, to be <hi>veracity,</hi> beyond all others, who have not the same: Now to leave out his bombast stuffing of Phantasms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I shall cast his Assertion by adding a Proposition to it into this form of Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Popish Christians by grace are far more fixt to Veracity, than others not imbued with those Heavenly Tenets</hi> (who yet naturally speak Truth, if design hinder not; yea even Fools and Drunkards) <hi>then a multitude of them incomparably exceeds in point of testifying the same number of others, unfortified by Christs Doctrine.</hi> But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popish Christians are far more fixt to vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city by Grace than others,</hi> &amp;c. Ergo, <hi>These Popish Christians must exceed in point of testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto their Tradition.</hi> This is the general sum.</p>
               <p>There is no wrong done to him by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his discourse thus. It is true <hi>Popish</hi> here is added to <hi>Christians;</hi> for such only he can intend, seeing he denieth such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances to any Christians out of his Church: and yet he deludes his <hi>Readers</hi> under the general notions of Christians, as if his witnesses were all professed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. This by the way</p>
               <p>To the Argument, 1. Seeing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is Hypothetical, including many
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48783:120"/> particulars, though we may grant it in the whole; yet several things supposed by him, and included in it, are false; As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is natural for every man to speak Truth, if d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. As to his instance in Fools and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards speaking Truth without artifice. Let his Popish witnesses be like them or go beyond them, he gains little by it; for those witless Creatures speak no truth of God at all, with which we have to do. And what Truth they do bewray, it is out of weakness or wickedness; and let the Authority then of such advance <hi>the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Popish Testifiers,</hi> so much as may be, (for with those he doth compare them.) And indeed they will prove spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fools, and Drunkards all. Whence may be judged easily, what truth they will testifie for Christ. In a word if <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> may hinder men from speaking truth, none are more to be suspected than Popish witnesses, whose Religion hath been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on from the first Defection to this
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48783:121"/> day upon <hi>Papal Designs,</hi> most inconsistent with the Faith of the Gospel.</p>

Were there nothing but their own <hi>Trent Testimony</hi>-work ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about this, a clearer Demonstration, cannot be given to prove the Averseness of <hi>Popish witnesses</hi> to <hi>Veracity,</hi> as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring Christs pure Doctrine and the way of his Salvation.

               <p n="2">2. Though we grant the power of Grace sufficient to take off hearts from the love of creatures, and to fix hearts upon the love of spiritual goods; Yet we deny this Effect wrought upon Popish Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48783:122"/> of the True Church: The Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Jesuitism hath revealed much of this.

               <p n="2">2. The next supernatural Assistance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Veracity of his Testifiers,</hi> is in <hi>S.</hi> 8. by him made to be <hi>supernatural Motives of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal goods and harms,</hi> subjected to mens hopes and fears, much more powerful than <hi>natural</hi> to oblige unto <hi>Veracity</hi> in natural matters, which the sufferings of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in all ages declare; therefore his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses having such motives, must needs speak truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this is a supernatural Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance objectively and externally to some, who may have an impression of it from Gods spirit, may be granted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But why doth the <hi>Discourser</hi> weary us with his <hi>Battisms,</hi> to tumble over the same things so often? The force of this hath been repulst before.</p>

                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:48783:122"/>3. We deny that these motives have prevailed with his Popish witnesses to speak Truth for Christ: For their Trent-Canons injoyn many lies and fables in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Gospel-Truth: Whatever force therefore those motives may have upon such, who duely receive them, to perswade them unto veracity, they have had none upon those Popish Testees; natural Tests concerning matters of Fact are much mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

He giveth us to consider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother supernatural Assistance unto his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiers for Tradition, which is the ingaging of them unto veracity by the Sacraments of the Church, held to have been instituted by Christ himself. Now if oaths and other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, do keep natural men to their Trust which are made by them; how much more must the Sacraments of Christ, both ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to all Christians, and special to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, oblige all not to prevaricate from the Faith held, nor belye their Fore-fathers, nor betray their Deposition?</p>

               <p>These two also, seeing both concern <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> may be well joyned in a reply to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether which we shall make concisely to them. Seeing in the one is pretended the <hi>Cause</hi> of that distemper of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> even the <hi>denial of his Tradition,</hi> and in the other is prescribed the <hi>Cure,</hi> viz. the receiving <hi>of it.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:48783:141"/>1. The Discourser doubtless was resolved to have a fling at the Fanaticks, or else very little overture was given him to make those Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries, from his pretended Tradition; but when he hath done, it is to no purpose to build these upon a begg'd foundation, which is already taken from him; therefore can infer no such thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If denial of <hi>Popish Tradition do proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and necessarily make Fanaticks,</hi> then all must be Fanaticks who do deny it, that is, who are no Papists; for all Protestants do deny his Tradition, as well as other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches: Never heard we Fanaticks so handsomely characteriz'd and described before. This is enough to make men post to Popery, that they may shun the mark of a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> of which name some are more afraid, than to be called a Papist. His Holiness oweth him a good reward for this. Yet he adds a self contradiction, when he saith, <hi>men may be so long preserved from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natickness, as they follow Tradition either in his Church or some other Congregation:</hi> which must be divers then from his, and deny his <hi>Tradition:</hi> however they maintain That of the doctrine of Christ written and preached by the Apostles.

The narrative of which is made clearly by some of their own. <hi>The reviving of this Tradition then is a more proper disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. Lastly to lay aside this great <hi>Battle-Axe of Fanaticism,</hi> (it having not been worth the taking up at all in our business) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but tell the Discourser, it is one of the greatest absurdities that hath fallen from the mouth of a man pretending to reason to say, <hi>Fanatick Principles are unconfutable but by Popish Tradition:</hi> Whereas a little before he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48783:142"/> had said, Men might be preserved from them by the sence of Christ declared in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregations, as well as by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his Church: now if that means can give preservation from it, needs must the same give confutation to it. We shall say no more to it, being not worthy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further confutation; we have light and strength enough through Grace to confute Fanatick Principles without his help. To try his strength yet, it were desirable, that all the Fanaticks were let loose upon him, to baite him with their Arguments, they might perhaps shake him and his Tradition to pieces, and make better sport than any <hi>Bear-baiting</hi> unto these Gentlemen, whose heels he labors to trip up by his <hi>Sure-foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>

               <p>Is this is a Corollary from his presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Traditions Certainty? He is a notable <hi>Artist to wire draw</hi> this, and exclude <hi>Christs Promise</hi> from bearing a part in the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or steering men in <hi>contending</hi> for his faith, which we understand by his <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sial Divines;</hi> as for other vain whifflers or <hi>Logomachists</hi> in his Schools, Christs <hi>Promise</hi> respects them not, neither do we regard them: As to his reiterated Ecchoes and noises in the air, we are even weary to hear them, they have been answered over and over. And therefore shall we conclude, <hi>Christs Promise</hi> to his own true <hi>Church (not to the Popish)</hi> is not only comfortable to the truly faithful, in giving hope of guidance in truth, here and of eternal and invisible glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the end of their way; but as it is

               <p>Passing by therefore his vain Exceptions of <hi>Christs promise</hi> being a <hi>Point of Faith,</hi> and thereupon no part of the Rule; and of the self-evidence of his Traditions Indefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; and of the weakness of Scriptures-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opened by private Interpretations, which have been re-recocted to the very vomiting of them up; we shall only animadvert upon his last suggestion against Christs promise bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a part in the Rule of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christs promise puts things delivered to be <hi>beleeved, not seen:</hi> What strange discourse hath the man here, about a matter little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Cause? Unless as he would have it, the Rule of Faith where the object is sence: Means to faith indeed are applicable to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of hearing and seeing; but the Rule of Faith, concerns the spirit of Faith only, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the inward faculties of the soul, Faith therefore is said to be the <hi>Evidence of things not seen,</hi> which are matters in promise,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1,</note> and we as beleevers are said to live by <hi>faith</hi> and not by <hi>sight.</hi> Things therefore not seen,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7.</note> must draw out and regulate acts of faith. How then can this Discourser exclude Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise from bearing a part in the Rule of Faith? By his leave therefore, He that saith of any
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48783:154"/> Event, that Gods will bringeth this about by the secondary Cause, speaks proper enough, as <hi>Philosopher and Divine.</hi> And no less he who asserteth Christs Promise by his spirit and word, is the Basis, Rule and Principle of saving faith, and that by which men can only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend victoriously for the same.

These things being generally premised, we shall proceed to consider the special Texts alledged by him; whether they give their consenting Authority to his <hi>Indefective Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> or not.</p>
               <p>1. He urgeth, sai. 35.8. of which place, 1. We have his Translation thus: <hi>This shall be unto you a direct way, so that Fools cannot erre in it.</hi> 2. His Interpretation, <hi>That is,</hi> saith he <hi>Evident to the Rudest vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or self evident;</hi> else Fools might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssibly erre in it, in case it needed any skill of Discourse, and were not obvious to common sense. So then his sence of it is <hi>This,</hi> that is, <hi>This Method of Popish Tradition, shall be to you a direct way,</hi> that is, this <hi>Method of Popish Tradition, shall be to you a direct way,</hi> that is, to you <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists Traditionary Christians,</hi> a plain and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48783:156"/> straight means unto salvation: <hi>So that Fools cannot erre in it.</hi> That is, <hi>the rudest vulgar</hi> among <hi>Papists,</hi> continuing such <hi>fools</hi> as to the knowledge of God, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by common sense, cannot miscarry in it.</p>
               <p>Unto this we shall but oppose the Truth of the letter, and natural sense; and then let wise men judge how this Scripture is forced by him for a <hi>consent</hi> to his <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which we shall do in this way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We give <hi>Scriptures Readers</hi> this note. That this Evangelical Prophet under the Jews Captivity unto, and deliverance from <hi>Babylon,</hi> describeth both spiritual bondage to sin, and redemption from it: Both are to be considered in the present promise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The true literal reading of the whole Text is this: <hi>And there shall be a troden path and a way</hi> (such as we call a <hi>Fosse-way) Even the way of Holiness shall be called on it, the unclean shall not passe over it; but this shall be for those; (viz.</hi> whose hands and feet were confirm'd and strengthned, <hi>&amp;c.) He that walketh the way, even fools shall not erre.</hi> Here is difference enough between Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The meaning then of it, as it concerns spiritual Redemption (typed under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Jews from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Sion,</hi> by <hi>the Decree of Cyrus</hi>) is this, <hi>Gods high-troden-Fosse-way to Salvation,</hi> is the <hi>way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Christ Jesus: The unholy and unclean
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48783:157"/> shall not passe over it,</hi> indeed they cannot, their feet sute not with it; but they whose feet are strengthened and cleansed shall pass thorough it, yea he <hi>or they who walkt his way of holiness,</hi> though formerly fools <hi>and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the way</hi> unto salvation, yet now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th them, and being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto his will, taken off from folly, even these <hi>shall not erre,</hi> or mistake the way to heaven. This is the naked and innate sence of this Promise; and what agreement hath this with the Discoursers gloss? God saith, <hi>Holiness</hi> is the way which will lead men to salvation, and they shall not erre: And the Discourser renders it, <hi>Romish Tradition</hi> is the way to salvation, in which though fools do walk, and abide such, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre. What Intelligent Reader will not nauseate at such senseless and unsavory glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as this. But it may be he will better it in the next; we shall try.</p>
               <p>2. To prove this way meant of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he tells us the same Prophet doth expresly declare it. Isai. 59.21. in these words: <hi>This is my Covenant with them, saith the Lord; my Spirit which is in thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart from thy mouth, and from the mouth of thy seed, and from the mouth of thy seeds seed from henceforth for ever.</hi> His Interpretation runs thus. 1. It is a promise of perpetuating Christs Doctrin. 2. That it expresseth on what manner;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48783:157"/> that is, as he saith, by <hi>Oral-Tradition,</hi> or delivering it from Father to Son <hi>by word of mouth;</hi> not by a <hi>Book.</hi> 3. That this <hi>Tradition shall be indefecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whereunto we shall only oppose these plain things evident to all rational obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the very letter of the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in this and the former verse are given to us two main Articles of Faith in Promise. 1. The <hi>Redeemers Advent</hi> 2. The <hi>Fathers Covenant</hi> to him, and in him to his seed the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That after the promise of the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers coming to <hi>Zion</hi> (that is, his <hi>Church, turn'd away from their Iniquities</hi>) he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Covenant both to him and them; wherein his Son manifested in the flesh the Redeemer,<note place="margin">Isai. 53 11.</note> is the first party with whom the Father covenanteth, and his seed begotten out of his bloody Travels are secondarily in and by him Parties confederate with the Father; so that none but these are in this Covenant or concerned in any of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters mentioned therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That under <hi>Spirit and word</hi> are carried all <hi>Grace</hi> tending to salvation, both given <hi>to him</hi> in the flesh <hi>without measure</hi> and to his seed according to their respective mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures assigned them;<note place="margin">Act. 10, Ps. 45 7</note> He was <hi>anointed</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghost and Power;</hi> or as paraphra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. That this is God the <hi>Fathers own Act</hi> incommunicable to any other, to put his <hi>Spirit upon Christ and his word or will in his mouth,</hi> and so upon his seed, and his seeds seed, in their perp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. That this Covenant the Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will perform and execute upon this seed of Christ only in their successive generations for ever, while sojourning in this Earth: The fruit whereof doubtless must be <hi>spirit and mouth-profession</hi> of the <hi>Fathers love</hi> while they have being. And to all this the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet adds three times here Gods <hi>Test,</hi> that <hi>Jehovah hath said it;</hi> therefore it must be done.</p>
               <p>Now this being the plain and simple sence of the words, what can this promise have to do, with <hi>Romish Church Apostate,</hi> or with <hi>Popish Tradition</hi> of Fore-fathers to their Children by word of mouth? Could ever the best of Fathers living put <hi>spirit</hi> upon their Chitdren, or the <hi>word and will</hi> of God into hearts and mouths to be beleeved and really professed and practiced by them, by their <hi>Oral-Tradition? Cain</hi> would then have been as good as <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Ishmael</hi> the

                  <hi>son of Promise</hi> as much as <hi>Isaac:</hi> Much less can Popish Fathers do it. We grant that the Doctrine of Christ unto Salvation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under this <hi>spirit and word:</hi> but the <hi>Tradition Indefectible and uninterrupted</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>perpetuation of it,</hi> in the seed of Christ only, throughout all their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, we assert peculiar unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone in his Son and by his Spirit: These are all the true words of <hi>Jehovah</hi> which he hath promised to perform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and thereby to fix his fear in the hearts of his, that they should never depart from him. What violence then is this that the <hi>Discourser</hi> should transfer all this unto <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Forefathers,</hi> as if they could put the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and Gods word into <hi>his mouth, and his seeds by their Oral-Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> And what madness is it to arrogate this spirit for <hi>supernatural Assistances</hi> to his <hi>Romish Church,</hi> who with her seed is a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemy to <hi>Gods word,</hi> (as this <hi>Disputer</hi> confesseth) unless it may be senced by his Tradition? It is as mad a prank for this man to challenge <hi>the Church</hi> to be his, that is, <hi>Popish,</hi> as it was of that mad fellow, who would call every <hi>ship</hi> his own, that he saw and yet he had none at all.

               <p>Now these things being so apparent in the native sense of this Scripture: Who seeth not what violence is offered unto it? when the writing this Law in hearts, is wrested to this corrupt sence, of making men acquainted with the law of God, that they by <hi>Tradition</hi> should convey it down to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And the work spoken of in this Text is only the Lords, wherein mans help of teaching is excluded?

               <p>2. His next rank <hi>of consenting Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> is humane; only here it is <hi>Complexe</hi> in <hi>Councils,</hi> the Representatives of the Church as he makes them: Among which he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nameth three in this order. 1 The first Synod of Lateran. 2. The Council <hi>Sardica.</hi> 3. The 7th. General Council of (as he calleth it) All as he saith consent to his <hi>Indefective Oral-Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:48783:161"/>
               <p>To return shortly and enough to these 1. Generally. 2. Specially. 1. In General we animadvert, that the <hi>Discourser</hi> urgeth his <hi>Consenters disorderly;</hi> For that of <hi>Sardica</hi> was much elder to the first <hi>Lateran:</hi> That being held under Pope <hi>Julius the first</hi> about <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 340. or a little after: And this was held under Pope <hi>Martin</hi> about the year 643. Order therefore might have set the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest first. 2. That in these Councils or some of them, the notion of <hi>Tradition</hi> is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the most ancient of them, especially of <hi>Scripture-delivery;</hi> and most usually; therefore the <hi>Disputer</hi> is either unwary or unfaithful to annex it only unto <hi>Oral-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi> So also is it used by the best of the Fathers to note <hi>Scripture-Tradition</hi> from the Apostles. 3. We acknowledg no <hi>Council</hi> expresly infallible, but that one of which we read, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> was <hi>President. Act.</hi> 15. Others have proudly boasted of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with them, but in vain. 4. As to all Councils, since that we professe our Faith concerning them, to be the same with our Church of <hi>England</hi> in these words. <hi>General Councils may erre</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore things ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them, as necessary to salvation, have neither strength nor Authority, unless it may be declared, that they be taken out of Holy Scripture.</hi> Upon this ground, we deal with the <hi>Discourser</hi> and shall not shrink from it: Unless Scripture Authorize both Councils and Tradition too, we shall trust neither of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48783:162"/> them: And this might be a sufficient answer from us to this Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet more specially, least he may think we fear his Witnesses.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Lateran</hi> Testimony, all that he urgeth is, They substracted nothing of those matters which were delivered to them by the Holy Fathers: Grant this, Those things were delivered first from the Holy Scriptures, as well as taught them by voice. Let the man disprove it if he can; if not, what helps this consent?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to that of <hi>Sardica</hi> (however it hath been branded and rejected by Ancients; which is enough to suspect it) yet all ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged here is nothing to the purpose; For if it were that they did hold Catholick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Faith and confession; This was by Scriptural, as well as by <hi>Oral-delivery.</hi> Nay <hi>Osius</hi> a Bishop (as their own <hi>Caranza</hi> giveth it) against ordination of Laicks, urgeth that Scripture against Novices,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.6.</note> So that here was use of written Tradition in this Council expressely, though unknown to this Disputer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to his 3d. It was the 2d. <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, which the Greeks (as the same <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza</hi> reports) did call the 7th General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil held in the year 780. under Pope <hi>Adrian the first,</hi> Bishop of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was celebrated against them, who condemned I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in Churches, and cast them out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was decreed, That images were rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to be worshipped, and the Reliques
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48783:162"/> of Saints honored. This being declared by their own Historian, and other idolatrous and abominable Constitutions (for which it hath been branded for a Filthie Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) the Discourser might be ashamed to urge it as a <hi>Consenting Authority,</hi> and that under the Title of the 7th <hi>General Council,</hi> when there was never so many stiled truly <hi>General,</hi> by almost half the number: But he had no better to make use of for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; Therefore his <hi>Tradition</hi> maketh this a <hi>General Council,</hi> and then the <hi>Authority of this</hi> must prove his <hi>Tradition Indefective</hi> from Christ; and so we run the round still. Yet we may excuse him, for he had much need of this Council to make his <hi>Tradition of Image worship indefectively descended</hi> from Christ. Let him hugge it, and perdition with it; but we abhorre it as an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conspiracy against the Lord and his Christ.</p>
               <p>3. His last consenting is humane also from single witnesses, such as he calleth Fathers, though all of them deserve not the Name. Popes may be his Fathers; they are none of ours. He urgeth some passages out of six of them; which we shall shortly review.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general we premise, 1. We ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the venerable name of Fathers in the Church, where truly named. 2. We say also according to our Church, Scripture is not to be beleeved for Fathers sake, but
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48783:163"/> Fathers for Scriptures sake: When they leave this they speak as men and so are to be esteemed. 3. <hi>Tradition</hi> generally used by them signifieth delivery of Gods mind by Scripture, as well as voice, and under both these not the manner but matter of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the will of God. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applyed to all his particular Instances, might be reply sufficient to the purpose for which he urgeth them: For he overlooks and mistakes them both in their Authority and use of the word <hi>Tradition,</hi> which he claims every where to be understood in his sence, for delivery oral, from mouth to mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In special we return. 1. To his <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestin</hi> (whom he stileth <hi>Saint and Pope;</hi>) Two Titles that seldome have met together, if we may believe his Historians concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the lives of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s <hi>Popes.</hi> Yet we have to do here with what he saies, more than with what he was: And to that which is urged by him, <hi>That we should belieue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what to this very time came by succession from the Apostles:</hi> And did not the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> come down to us by that succession? what makes this passage more for <hi>Oral-Tradition?</hi> Nay to what follows, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did leave us the Scriptures, therefore we must follow them. And whatever he speaks more of his Testimony relates as much to scriptural, as to <hi>Oral-Tradition</hi> from the Apostles: which we have cause to beleeve,

               <p n="4">4. As to <hi>Athanasius;</hi> it is wonderful that any should be so impudent to urge h s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for <hi>Oral-Tradition</hi> against <hi>Scripture,</hi> when every man may see th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. As for <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> It is most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that this man should pick out some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent shreds out of his discourse and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to his corrupt ends; when as he is known to be a most strong Assertor of <hi>Scriptures Power and Authority</hi> to be the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> and sheweth it to be the Cause of mens Errors, that they forsake that <hi>Rule of Truth.</hi> He that will know the true Testimony of this witness must read him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His last is <hi>Austin,</hi> whom whosoever urgeth as a witness for <hi>Oral-Tradition</hi> against <hi>Scripture,</hi> must have a face of brass; for none more maintains the <hi>written Truth</hi> of God to be the Rule of faith than He.

               <p>We shall note; That his pretended answer is only to the first, unto the second he speaks not one word: which had been <hi>Honesty</hi> to have done, and would have given us more light concerning the matter in debate, than any thing in all his discourses.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We animadvert, that to the first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion he answereth not one word directly but obliquely he insinuates it must be the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> for he hath told us before,
